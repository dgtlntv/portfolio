# Hello World - Getting Started with MDX

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using MDX, a powerful format that combines the best of Markdown and JSX.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This opens up new possibilities for creating rich, interactive blog posts and documentation.

Some of the key benefits of MDX include:

- **Component-based content**: Embed and reuse React components within your markdown
- **Interactive examples**: Create live coding examples and interactive demos
- **Rich media support**: Easily include galleries, videos, and other media in a consistent way

## Getting Started with MDX

To use MDX in your project, you'll need to set up a few dependencies:

1. Install the necessary packages
2. Configure your build system (Vite, Next.js, etc.)
3. Create your first MDX file

## Custom Components

MDX allows you to use custom components within your markdown. For example, here's an image gallery component:

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      id: 1,
      src: "https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/e2f4ff/0076ce?text=MDX+Gallery+1",
      alt: "MDX Gallery Example 1",
      name: "This is the first image",
      caption: "A beautiful example of MDX in action with a gallery component"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      src: "https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/fff5e2/ce7600?text=MDX+Gallery+2", 
      alt: "MDX Gallery Example 2",
      name: "This is the second image",
      caption: "Another example showing a different color scheme"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Code Syntax Highlighting

MDX makes it easy to add syntax-highlighted code blocks:

```javascript
// A simple greeting function
function greet(name) {
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(greeting);
  return greeting;
}

// Call the function
greet('World');
```

You can also use other languages:

```css
/* Styling our blog */
.blog-post {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
}

.blog-post h1 {
  color: #0076ce;
  font-size: 2.5rem;
}
```

## What's Next?

In future posts, I'll explore more advanced MDX features and show how to create even more interactive content. Stay tuned!
