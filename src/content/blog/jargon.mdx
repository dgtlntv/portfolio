excerpt:
    Jargon is the specific terminology associated with a particular field or
    area of activity. It is well documented that jargon can have a negative impact on
    communication between professionals and laypeople. When niche words and
    phrases are used in applications that are intended for first time users,
    these unfamiliar words become meaningless jargon that provides no value. It
    clouds and complicates meaning, which is irritating and alienating to users,
    with potentially harmful consequences to all parties.

## What is Jargon

Jargon is specific terminology associated with a particular domain. It is
essential to describe new entities for which there is no name yet, and it
ensures the lingual precision and accuracy required for some domains. Jargon
definitely has its place in the world as a means of making communication between
experts more efficient and precise. But suppose it is used in the wrong context,
for example, in an app intended for end consumers. In that case, it can have a
clear negative impact on the communication between the application and the user.
When niche words and phrases are used in applications intended for users who are
not experts in the domain, these words become meaningless and hold no value. It
obfuscates and complicates meaning, which can be irritating and off-putting to
users and ultimately detrimental to both the user and the application.

From my research, I can say that pretty much all blockchain applications are
full of jargon. While the terms "**airdrop**”, "**oracles**”, "**smart
contracts**” and "**gas**" may be second nature to blockchain enthusiasts, they
are meaningless and confusing to people taking their first steps into
blockchain.

## Why Jargon is bad

There are two ways in which jargon can be bad. The first is when it is poorly
formed — for example, when it is linguistically incorrect, a misnomer,
unnecessarily long, or similar (a more detailed list can be found in [2](#2)).
Although jargon in blockchain often falls into this category (i.e.,
**Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge** or zkSNARK
👀), I will focus on the second type of Jargon in this article: jargon that is
ill-adapted to its audience.

This second poor use of jargon is anywhere in an application intended for
end-users who are not blockchain experts. Likely, the majority of blockchain
users will not understand blockchain jargon when they are first getting started.
And if jargon is not understood, it might lead to unwanted outcomes.

Users only have limited mental energy at their disposal. In order to understand
jargon that they are not familiar with, they must expend some of that mental
energy to hypothesize about the word or look it up. More energy is then used to
read and absorb the rest of the sentence, and the remaining mental energy must
be used to internalize the sentence’s content and to understand the meaning.
That means that the more frequently jargon is used in an app, the more time and
attention users must spend absorbing and understanding the information. Time and
attention that should instead be spent on what's important at this point
—understanding the information you want to convey in your interface.

In summary, jargon forces new users to spend unnecessary mental energy on
understanding new, obscure words. Instead **this energy should be used on
actually understanding the product** and any information that is necessary for
users to be able to use the app successfully.

This extra effort often leads to frustration on the part of users. It can lead
to fundamentals being misunderstood and wrong actions being taken. Erroneous
action in blockchain is often much more fatal than in traditional web
applications, because many actions in blockchain cannot be reversed. In the
worst case, jargon could lead users to abandon an app out of frustration and
lack of understanding.

Finally, jargon makes an app less accessible because it disadvantages people
with cognitive/learning disabilities and people with limited language
comprehension.

## Jargon in Blockchain applications

The following screenshots are not meant to criticize the design of the apps. On
the contrary, most of the applications shown are very well designed! Some of
these apps may have deliberately chosen to use particular jargon, because their
app’s target audience is more experienced users. Thus, these screenshots are
only meant to be examples of the prevalence of jargon in blockchain applications
in general.

## Conclusion

If blockchain products are to be usable by everyone, at every level of
understanding, then applications will have to communicate to users in a way that
everyone can quickly and easily understand. They should use jargon sparsely, and
communicate in as plain language as possible. Otherwise, as described above,
niche phrases will increase users’ mental overhead considerably. I know that it
is difficult to determine what is jargon and what is not when you are deeply
familiar with a subject. It happens to me all the time. However, as designers
(and people interested in design), it's our job to bridge the gap between
specialists and end-users. We should take a step back and evaluate if all the
information in the text of an application is easy and quick to understand. In
the end, an easy to understand application creates the best outcomes for
everyone — inside and outside the blockchain domain.
