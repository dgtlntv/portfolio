    While doing user research for one of Canonicals CLIs I realised there are no
    good tools for prototyping and user testing CLIs. So I created my own â€“
    Protostar.

The digital infrastructure software that Canonical develops can be quite
challenging to set up and install. And so was MAAS (Metal as a Service) the
product I was working on at the time. Especially if you want to deploy MAAS in
high-availability (HA) (setting up 3 identical installations so if one fails
another one can take over) things can become tricky. Thats why the MAAS team
worked on a CLI tool that makes installing MAAS in HA easier: MAAS Anvil. The
team was preparing MAAS Anvil for a Beta release and wanted to identify any
significant usability gaps beforehand. There was also interest in understanding
better how best to add new features being considered, which had several
implementation options, but it wasn't certain which experience would work best
for users.

I began by creating a comprehensive research brief outlining the purpose of the
study, the assumptions that needed to be tested, and my methodology. After
sharing this with the team to ensure alignment on research objectives, I
developed an interview guide that would help understand user behaviors and
preferences. During this process, I realized that testing different feature
implementation options would require some form of prototype.

## User testing CLIs

But the problem is that there aren't any good options for prototyping and user
testing command-line interfaces. Figma prototypes were inadequate because users
couldn't type actual commands, only click through predetermined paths. Simply
reviewing command structures in a document failed to provide the interaction
depth of a real CLI experience. And while coding a functioning CLI would be
technically possible, it would require participants to install software before
interviews. An immediate barrier when working with system administrators who are
understandably skeptical about installing unknown packages on their systems.
Ideally, the solution would be as frictionless as Figma prototypes, where
researchers can simply send a link to participants.

This prompted me to hack together a CLI prototypiong tool on my own on a friday
afternoon. I knew about [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/), a terminal library
used by established apps like Visual Studio Code. I used it and other libraries
to build a prototype that emulated a terminal environment entirely in the
browser, with no installation required.

    Despite the prototype being a bit buggy, it worked remarkably well in user
    research sessions. It allowed participants to interact with the CLI
    naturally by typing commands, exploring different paths, and providing
    feedback on the various implementation options being considered. The quality
    of user insights was substantially better than what could have been achieved
    through static mockups or theoretical discussions.

## Sharing user insights

        },

After having done the interviews I started to analyze them. Looking for research
trends across all interviews etc. Once I found some trends and insights I put
them into a UX heuristics matrix to make the different insights easier to
communicate to stakeholders. Once having the UX heuristics insights I compiled
more concrete suggestions in how to proceede with improving the tool and adding
new features. I presented all of this to my stakeholders in a meeting. The
research and the suggestions were received well and the team looked into how to
fix the identified issues.

    One of the biggest insights of the research was that the documentation of
    the tool (including help messages in the CLI) was not yet where it needed to
    be for users to confidently use the tool. As I already had gotten
    familiarity with the tool and an understanding of what users were unsure
    about I helped write the documentation and help messages in the tool.

# Future of prototyping CLIs

After synthesizing and sharing the research findings with the team, I reflected
on the prototyping solution I had created. The approach seemed valuable beyond
my immediate needs for this research project. It could potentially be helpful
for other designers (or developers) conducting CLI user research or anyone
needing to quickly prototype command-line experiences.

<FloatImage src="/videos/projects/protostar/protostar.webm">
    This led me to develop it further as an open-source prototyping tool and
    library called [Protostar](https://github.com/dgtlntv/protostar). Protostar
    has already gained traction among designers at Canonical who need to test
    CLI interfaces. It also got some attention when it was mentioned during a
    presentation on CLI design at FOSDEM by one of Canonicals Design directors,
    generating interest from the open-source community. What began as a
    practical solution to a specific research challenge has evolved into a
    specialized tool that fills a genuine gap in the UX design toolkit,
    particularly for those working with command-line interfaces.
