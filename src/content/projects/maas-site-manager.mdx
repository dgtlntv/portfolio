# Project Background

I was tasked with developing a map feature for MAAS Site Manager, based on
earlier user research that identified location information as valuable context.
Users needed to know where in the world their data centers and sites were
located to effectively manage their infrastructure. For example, when
troubleshooting errors, users needed to quickly identify which region was
affected, or when planning deployments, they needed visibility into data center
locations in specific regions. A map visualization emerged as the most intuitive
way to display this information. Requirements and Constraints One critical
requirement from product management was that the feature needed to work in
air-gapped environments where internet access is restricted or unavailable. This
posed a significant technical challenge, as most map solutions rely on online
services. Design Process I began the project by creating several iterations of
wireframes, collaborating closely with other designers to refine the
visualization approach. As a visually-oriented project, these design sessions
were crucial for establishing how users would interact with the geographical
data. The Technical Challenge During a regular check-in with developers, when
they began investigating map implementation options, they identified a potential
roadblock. They found that hosting a detailed world map would require storing
tens of gigabytes of map data within MAAS Site Manager itself—a significant
burden they considered impractical. The development team advocated for using an
online map service like OpenStreetMaps instead, which would avoid hosting large
amounts of data but would violate our core requirement of functioning in
air-gapped environments. Beyond the technical constraint, I had additional
concerns with this approach:

We would have limited control over the map's visual appearance The maps would
include excessive detail for our use case, potentially distracting users from
their primary tasks The third-party maps would look out of place in our
application and not align with our brand identity

Taking Initiative Having recently worked with map data on a personal project, I
knew there was a better solution than what the developers were suggesting, but
they were hesitant to explore alternatives further. I decided to take the
initiative and create a proof of concept demonstrating how we could build a map
with:

Sufficient detail for our specific use case Custom styling that matched our
brand A dramatically reduced file size (tens of megabytes instead of tens of
gigabytes)

Implementation and Results After developing the proof of concept, I was able to
convince the development team that this approach was feasible. Using my
prototype as a reference, they implemented a proper system for generating
optimized maps for our application. The result was a successful map feature in
MAAS Site Manager that displays the right level of detail, maintains visual
consistency with our design system, and—most importantly—functions in air-gapped
environments without requiring internet connectivity. This project demonstrates
how taking initiative to bridge the gap between design requirements and
technical constraints can lead to better solutions that meet both user needs and
business requirements.
