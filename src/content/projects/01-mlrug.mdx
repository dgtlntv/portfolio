In the design theory lecture at my university, we often discussed the role of
machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence in the design process.
One conclusion from this discussion was that generative algorithms will play an
increasingly important role in the design process, to the point where the role
of the designer could shift from creator to curator. However, these discussions
were all theoretical in nature, and I wanted to explore what that would mean in
practice. I wanted to carry out a project in which I experimented with
generative algorithms as a design tool, which led to a year-long experiment that
lasted from my time at university until today.

I started this project a couple of years before many of the impressive AI tools
([Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion),
[VEO](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/),
[GPT-5](https://openai.com/de-DE/index/introducing-gpt-5/), etc.) we have today
existed. The only realistic way for me to conduct this experiment was to train
my own algorithm (based on other people's algorithms, of course).

As with so many projects in the field of machine learning, one of the most
important considerations for me was the question of what data I would feed into
my generative algorithm. I wanted to choose a design object that I was
reasonably familiar with, for which I could obtain a sufficient amount of data,
and that could be represented as an image (since 3D generative design is much
more difficult). Based on these considerations, I opted for Moroccan carpets. I
am very familiar with Moroccan carpets because my father trades with them, which
also gives me access to image data of Moroccan carpets. I supplemented the data
I was able to obtain from my father with images from the internet, which I
collected using a web crawler. In the end, I was able to obtain about 3.000
images of Moroccan carpets. This is not a huge amount in the context of a
generative algorithm, but enough to get first reasonably useful results.

## Algorithm and Computing

I investigated various architectures and algorithms and finally settled on
[HyperGAN](https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN). At the time, it was an
appropriately powerful architecture for this project and was specifically
designed to lower the barrier to entry for artists and designers. For my first
test, I ran [HyperGAN](https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN) on my laptop, but I
quickly realized that my laptop's graphics card (GTX1050) would not be
sufficient for a full run.

So I turned to cloud solutions. In the process, I landed on
[Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/), which is based on DigitalOcean (afaik
it was AWS then) but offers a simpler user experience and is optimized for
machine learning. There, I did a number of different training runs with my data,
using different resolutions and parameters. In the end, I found that
[HyperGAN](https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN)'s default parameters and a
resolution of 256x256 worked best for me.

                },

    I wouldn't call the results perfect, but for the amount of data and
    technical knowledge I had at the time, I think they were reasonable. At this
    point, it's clear that training an algorithm on a small scale like this
    isn't really going to replace a designer's design process. But it can serve
    as inspiration. And it definitely did in this project.

## From Digital to Physical

When I first experimented with generative adversarial networks (GANs) in 2019, I
achieved only moderate results. However, the results improved significantly when
I revisited this project together with my sister Ida, who was working on her
master's thesis on the historical pattern development in Moroccan carpets. We
wanted to explore the parallels between traditional carpet pattern development
and AI pattern development processes. Traditional carpet patterns evolved
through geographical migration across the Mediterranean, blending influences
from diverse cultures including the Berbers, Arab nomads, Moorish Andalusians,
and Ottomans. We're interested in comparing this analog, cross-cultural pattern
evolution with the digital pattern development processes used by AI systems. Our
goal was to investigate whether the machine learning approach to pattern
generation can be viewed through the same lens as the centuries-old tradition of
motifs that have developed and spread from urban manufactories to rural
communities and back again.

                },

For this second iteration of the project I reevaluated which algorithm to use
and landed on StyleGAN2-ada, a variant specifically designed for training with
fewer images. Using my father's high-quality photo archive again and this time
supplemented by much more carefully selected internet images, we achieved much
better results than in my first iteration. Showing how much machine learning had
evolved in such a short time (and how much of an effect good quality data can
have).

The most exciting part of this collaboration with my sister and father was that
it brought me full circle, returning me to my original curiosity about using
machine learning as a tool in the design process by actually bringing these
digital creations back into the physical world.

Rather than choosing Indian or Nepalese manufactories with their precision
technology that would allow nearly photographic reproduction, we deliberately
opted for production in Morocco. The rhizomatic producer landscape there
consisting of many small, interconnected local businesses allowed us to maintain
the character and vitality of the original designs while ensuring value creation
remained in the country that inspired our work.

Working with a producer from the western Middle Atlas that my father had
collaborated with for several years, we were able to translate the
algorithmically generated designs into handcrafted rugs. The result was not a
mechanical reproduction but rather a living interpretation that preserved the
improvisational qualities that make Moroccan rugs special.

These algorithmically generated, curated and handcrafted rugs were presented as
part of [Design Month Graz 2025](https://www.designmonat.at/en/event/mlrug/).

The project gained recognition beyond the exhibition, being featured in two
articles in Cover, a leading publication in handmade carpets and textiles for
interiors.

This coverage positioned MLRug within important industry conversations about the
intersection of traditional craft and emerging technology. Lucy Upward's feature
article<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> explored the project's conceptual
framework, examining how AI's pattern-learning process mirrors the historical
migration of motifs along ancient trade routes. Meanwhile, Denna Jones's
analysis<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup> used MLRug as an exemplary case study
for ethical AI implementation in design, by keeping production in Morocco and
creating a purpose-built dataset to avoid copyright concerns.
