In the design theory class at my college, we often discussed the role of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence in the design process. One conclusion from this
discussion was that generative algorithms will play an increasingly important role in the design process, to the point where the role of the designer might change from creator to
curator. With that in mind I wanted to do a project where I experiment with generative algorithms as a design tool.

    As with so many machine learning projects, one of the biggest considerations
    for me was the data I would feed my generative algorithm with. I wanted to
    choose a design object that I was reasonably familiar with, could get a
    sufficient amount of data, and could be represented as an image (since 3d
    generative design from scratch is much more difficult). Through these
    considerations I chose Moroccan carpets. I am very familiar with Moroccan
    carpets, as my father deals with them, which also gives me access to image
    data of Moroccan carpets. The data I could get through my father I
    supplemented with images from the internet which I collected with a
    web-crawler. In the end I was able to obtain about 3000 images of Moroccan
    carpets. This is not a huge amount in the context of a generative algorithm,
    but enough to get reasonably useful results.

## Algorithm and Computing

I investigated various architectures and algorithms and finally settled on HyperGan. At the time, it was an appropriately powerful architecture for this project and was
specifically designed to lower the barrier to entry for artists and designers. For my first test, I ran HyperGAN on my laptop, but I quickly realized that my laptop's graphics card
(GTX1050) would not be sufficient for a full run. So I turned to a cloud solution. In the process, I landed on Paperspace, which is based on AWS but offers a simpler user
experience and is optimized for machine learning. There, I did a number of different runs with my data, using different resolutions and parameters. In the end, I found that
HyperGAN's default algorithm and a resolution of 256x256 worked best for me.

    I wouldn't call the results perfect, but for the amount of data and
    technical knowledge I had, I think they were reasonable. At this point, it's
    clear that training an algorithm on a small scale like this isn't really
    going to replace a designer's design process. But it can serve as
    inspiration. And it definitely did in this project. I'm currently working
    with my father to produce a rug (in Morocco) inspired by the designs that
    came through this GAN.
