In the design theory class at my college, we often discussed the role of machine
learning algorithms and artificial intelligence in the design process. One
conclusion from this discussion was that generative algorithms will play an
increasingly important role in the design process, to the point where the role
of the designer might change from creator to curator. With that in mind I wanted
to do a project where I experiment with generative algorithms as a design tool.

    As with so many machine learning projects, one of the biggest considerations for
    me was the data I would feed my generative algorithm with. I wanted to choose a
    design object that I was reasonably familiar with, could get a sufficient amount
    of data, and could be represented as an image (since 3D generative design from
    scratch is much more difficult). Through these considerations I chose Moroccan
    carpets.

    I am very familiar with Moroccan carpets, as my father deals with them, which
    also gives me access to image data of Moroccan carpets. The data I could get
    through my father I supplemented with images from the internet which I collected
    with a web-crawler. In the end I was able to obtain about 3000 images of
    Moroccan carpets. This is not a huge amount in the context of a generative
    algorithm, but enough to get reasonably useful results.

## Algorithm and Computing

I investigated various architectures and algorithms and finally settled on
HyperGan. At the time, it was an appropriately powerful architecture for this
project and was specifically designed to lower the barrier to entry for artists
and designers. For my first test, I ran HyperGAN on my laptop, but I quickly
realized that my laptop's graphics card (GTX1050) would not be sufficient for a
full run.

So I turned to a cloud solution. In the process, I landed on Paperspace, which
is based on AWS but offers a simpler user experience and is optimized for
machine learning. There, I did a number of different runs with my data, using
different resolutions and parameters. In the end, I found that HyperGAN's
default algorithm and a resolution of 256x256 worked best for me.

                },

                },
                {

                    alt: "Initial AI-generated carpet design 4",
                },
                {

                },

    I wouldn't call the results perfect, but for the amount of data and
    technical knowledge I had, I think they were reasonable. At this point, it's
    clear that training an algorithm on a small scale like this isn't really
    going to replace a designer's design process. But it can serve as
    inspiration. And it definitely did in this project.

## From Digital to Physical

What began as an experimental exploration evolved into a complete design
journey. In 2019, I trained my first models using generative adversarial
networks (GANs), achieving moderate results. The breakthrough came when I
revisited the project in collaboration with my sister Ida, who was exploring
pattern development in Moroccan carpets for her master's thesis.

    For this second iteration, I chose StyleGAN2-ada, a variant specifically
    designed for training with fewer images. Using my father's high-quality
    photo archive supplemented by carefully selected internet images, we
    achieved surprisingly good quality results that sparked interesting
    discussions about the parallels between how AI learns compared to humans,
    and how this relates to the history of rug design in Morocco.

    The most exciting development was bringing these digital creations back into the
    physical world. Rather than choosing Indian or Nepalese manufactories with their
    precision technology that would allow nearly photographic reproduction, we
    deliberately opted for production in Morocco. The rhizomatic producer landscape
    there—consisting of many small, interconnected local businesses—allowed us to
    maintain the character and vitality of the original designs while ensuring value
    creation remained in the country that inspired our work.

    Working with a producer from the western Middle Atlas that my father had
    collaborated with for several years, we were able to translate the AI-generated
    designs into handcrafted rugs. The result was not mechanical reproduction but
    rather a living interpretation that preserved the improvisational qualities that
    make Moroccan rugs special.

## Recognition and Media Coverage

The project gained recognition beyond the exhibition, being featured in two
articles in Cover, a leading trade magazine for interior design and
architecture. This coverage helped highlight the innovative approach of
combining AI technology with traditional Moroccan craftsmanship, bringing
attention to the potential for thoughtful integration of artificial intelligence
in design practice.

## Reflection and Conclusion

The project has deepened my understanding of AI's role in design—not as a
replacement for human creativity, but as a tool that can open new possibilities
when used thoughtfully and critically. Through this journey, I've come to a more
nuanced view of AI in design. While I remain technology-positive, I've become
concerned about the trend of designers completely delegating their thinking and
creativity to AI rather than using it to enhance their creative process. The
best results come from a balanced approach where AI serves as one tool among
many in the designer's toolkit.
