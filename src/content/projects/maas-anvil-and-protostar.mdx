When tasked with evaluating the user experience of MAAS Anvil at Canonical, I
faced a unique challenge. MAAS Anvil is a CLI tool designed to simplify
high-availability installations of MAAS (Metal as a Service), and we needed to
identify any significant usability gaps before releasing it as a beta.
Additionally, we were considering adding new features with several
implementation options, but we weren't certain which experience users would
prefer. I began by creating a comprehensive research brief outlining the purpose
of the study, the assumptions we wanted to test, and our methodology. After
sharing this with the team to ensure alignment on research objectives, I
developed an interview guide that would help us understand user behaviors and
preferences.

During this process, I realized that testing different feature implementation
options would require some form of prototype. This led to a significant
realization: there didn't seem to be any good options for prototyping and user
testing command-line interfaces. Figma prototypes were inadequate because users
couldn't type actual commands, only click through predetermined paths. Simply
reviewing command structures in a document failed to provide the interaction
depth of a real CLI experience. While coding a functioning CLI would be
technically possible, it would require participants to install software before
interviews—an immediate barrier when working with system administrators who are
understandably skeptical about installing unknown packages on their systems.
Ideally, the solution would be as frictionless as Figma prototypes, where
researchers can simply send a link to participants.

This gap in available tools prompted me to create a browser-based CLI prototype.
I knew about xterm.js, the terminal library used by Visual Studio Code, and
leveraged it to build a prototype that emulated a terminal environment entirely
in the browser, with no installation required. Despite its initial bugginess,
the prototype worked remarkably well in user research sessions. It allowed
participants to interact with the CLI naturally by typing commands, exploring
different paths, and providing feedback on the various implementation options we
were considering. The quality of user insights was substantially better than
what we could have achieved through static mockups or theoretical discussions.
After synthesizing and sharing the research findings with the team, I reflected
on the prototyping solution I'd created. The approach seemed valuable beyond our
immediate needs—potentially helpful for other designers conducting CLI user
research or anyone needing to quickly prototype command-line experiences. This
led me to develop it further as an open-source prototyping tool and library
called Protostar. Protostar has already gained traction among designers at
Canonical who need to test CLI interfaces. It even caught broader attention when
Canonical's Design Director mentioned it during presentations on CLI design at
FOSDEM, generating interest from the open-source community. What began as a
practical solution to a specific research challenge has evolved into a
specialized tool that fills a genuine gap in the UX design toolkit, particularly
for those working with command-line interfaces.
