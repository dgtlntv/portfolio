## Problem

Everyone knows the numbing feeling that comes with an 50-slide presentation. This phenomenon is often called _"Death by PowerPoint"_. A deadly
boring presentation, in which the interest of the recipient dies through "the PowerPoint" alone. Edward Tufte, a renowned scientist, even assigns partial blame for the crash of
the space shuttle Columbia to this phenomenon in the report of the Nasa accident investigation committee.

It may not have as fatal consequences in most organizations as the space shuttle crash. It does, however, lead to an inefficient communication culture plagued by inattention,
misunderstandings, and the resulting extra expenditure of time, energy, and thus capital.

But what would a presentation look like that does justice to today's dynamic, flexible and interactive communication? The ideal situation would be one in which the person
presenting can speak freely and interact with the audience without having to worry about the navigation or layout of the presentation. The core idea of Talk is therefore to
automatically create the navigation of the visualizations and the structuring elements (layout, animations, etc.) based on what is spoken. This means that during a presentation the
spoken words are recorded with a microphone and based on that the correct visualizations are displayed, arranged and animated.

## How it works

    Unlike traditional presentation software, Talk requires a script when
    creating the presentation. This script can consist of either complete
    sentences or meaningful keywords. Passages from this script are then linked
    to the visualizations that are to be displayed when that passage is spoken.
    During the presentation, the person presenting speaks freely. What is spoken
    is recorded and analyzed by the software. The spoken word is compared with
    the passages from the script, the most similar one is found and the
    associated visualization is displayed. It is important here that the
    comparison does not take place on the basis of keywords or the like. The
    comparison takes place based on semantic content. This means that not the
    exact same words have to be pronounced as they appear in the script, but
    only the same content. Furthermore, what is spoken is examined for
    sentiment, emphasis and figures of speech. The purpose of structuring
    elements in a presentation is to create a visual hierarchy. That is, to
    emphasize what is of high (or low) importance at that moment in the
    presentation. In language, sentiment, emphasis, and figures of speech are
    used to convey this hierarchy. Everyone has an intuitive sense of how to use
    these to convey what information is important in a (spoken) sentence. This
    hierarchy, already present in language, can be translated into the visual to
    create structuring elements that have a strong relationship to what is being
    said.

> in the foreground and Y would move to the background.

## Technology

Talk differs from conventional presentation software by the described interaction concept and by the technologies, that make it possible. The technological core of Talk are Machine
Learning algorithms of the category [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (techniques and methods for the machine processing of natural language). In particular, three subcategories of NLP are important to the function of of Talk: [Speech-to-Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition), [Semantic Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity) and [Document Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification).

## Talk

Talk would be completely new way of presenting and is not comparable to any offering on the market. All presentation programs currently available on the market are slide-based and
therefore have the same problems (including Prezi). Since both the structuring elements and the navigation are generated automatically, based on what is spoken, the person
presenting does not have to worry about the layout or navigation of the presentation, unlike traditional presentation software. This solves the shortcomings of PowerPoint and
creates a better presentation and communication culture:

- One can respond to questions immediately. One does not have to navigate to the right slide first.
- One can move freely on the "stage". One no longer has to stand by the laptop to navigate the presentation.
- You are not tempted to read from slides.
- Layouts no longer have to be created by hand.
    - No more slides with 20 bullet points.
