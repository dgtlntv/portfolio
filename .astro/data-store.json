MAAS\n(Metal as a Service) is bare metal management software that can manage servers\neven without, for example, an operating system installed. The users are deeply\ntechnical IT professionals who manage large-scale infrastructure deployments.\n\nI focused primarily on MAAS Site Manager, a companion application designed to\naddress a significant pain point for users managing multiple data centers. While\nperformance requirements dictate one MAAS installation per data center, this\ncreates operational challenges: users lack unified oversight of their\ninfrastructure, must replicate configurations and boot images across\ninstallations, and frequently struggle to ensure they're performing actions on\nthe correct MAAS instance.\n\nMAAS Site Manager was created as the solution. A centralized management\ninterface for multiple MAAS installations. I contributed to this project from\nits inception, helping shape it from initial concept through MVP delivery.\n\n## Geographic visualization challenge\n\nOne of the key features I designed for the MVP was the map visualization. Prior\nuser research revealed that users needed geographic awareness of their MAAS\ninstallations to effectively manage distributed infrastructure. When\ntroubleshooting errors, they required quick identification of affected regions,\nand when planning deployments, they needed visibility into data center locations\nacross specific geographic areas.\n\nIn this research we also found that a map visualization would be the most\nintuitive solution for this geographic information. However, we also had a\ncritical constraint from product management: the feature needed to function in\nair-gapped environments where internet connectivity is restricted or\nunavailable. This requirement was a significant technical and design challenge,\nas most mapping solutions depend on online services.\n\n## Design process and constraints\n\nI began the project by creating several iterations of wireframes, addressing\nboth visual and interaction design challenges. The map needed visual clarity for\nthe specific use case while enabling users to interact with sites: selecting\nindividual or multiple locations and performing actions on them.\n\n![MAAS Site Manager wireframe showing European map with clustered server location markers, with dense clusters around Vienna area and scattered markers across other European cities, including sidebar navigation for Regions, Settings, and user account](/images/projects/maas-site-manager/site-manager-wireframe-clustered-markers.webp)\n\nThe design had to accommodate potentially tens of thousands of sites, requiring\nscalable rendering solutions. Displaying 30,000 sites simultaneously would be\nneither technically performant nor visually useful to users. I needed to create\nuser flows that were intuitive for site interaction and selection while ensuring\nthe interface could scale effectively.\n\n![MAAS Site Manager wireframe displaying regional view of Europe with individual server location pins scattered across countries, showing '20 MAAS regions' with search functionality and map/table view toggles in the interface](/images/projects/maas-site-manager/site-manager-wireframe-regional-view.webp)\n\nThroughout the design process, I conducted frequent feedback sessions with other\ndesigners to refine flows and visual approaches, and with developers to validate\ntechnical feasibility.\n\n## Technical roadblock and alternative solution\n\nDuring one of these developer feedback session, we identified a significant\ntechnical challenge. Off-the-shelf open source map tiles (the building blocks of\ndigital maps) require tens to hundreds of gigabytes of storage. Shipping this\ndata with MAAS Site Manager would create an impractical burden for users,\nparticularly since most self-host the application.\n\n![OpenStreetMap integration example showing detailed European map with country boundaries, city names, and geographical features like rivers and terrain, demonstrating the level of detail would be too much for MAAS Site manager](/images/projects/maas-site-manager/openstreetmap-integration.webp)\n\nThe development team proposed using an online map service like OpenStreetMaps to\navoid hosting large datasets, but this would violate one of the core\nrequirements, that it would work in an air-gapped environment. Beyond the\ntechnical constraint, I had additional concerns with this approach: limited\ncontrol over visual appearance, excessive detail that could distract users from\ntheir primary tasks, and visual inconsistency with our brand identity.\n\nHaving recently worked with map data on a personal project (detecting potential\nnew rock climbing areas using machine learning algorithms on satellite images),\nI knew there was a better solution. While the development team was hesitant to\nexplore alternatives further, I decided to create a proof of concept\ndemonstrating how to build a map with sufficient detail for our specific use\ncase, custom styling that matched our brand, and dramatically reduced file size\n(tens of megabytes instead of tens of gigabytes).\n\nI achieved this by customizing the tile building process (with\n[tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe)), selecting only the map\nfeatures necessary for our bare metal server management use case. This approach\neliminated distracting details irrelevant to our use case while significantly\nreducing map tile size.\n\nAfter developing the proof of concept, I convinced the development team that\nthis approach was feasible. Using my prototype as a reference, they implemented\na proper system for generating optimized maps for our application.\n\n## Results and validation\n\n![Final MAAS Site Manager map interface showing clean, minimalist world map with numbered orange location markers indicating '155 MAAS sites' across different continents, featuring custom styling with branded orange pins and simplified geography](/images/projects/maas-site-manager/server-location-map-interface.webp)\n\nThe result was a successful map feature in MAAS Site Manager that displays the\nappropriate level of detail, maintains visual consistency with our design\nsystem, and functions in air-gapped environments without requiring internet\nconnectivity.\n\nUser testing with internal users validated the approach. Participants\nsuccessfully completed tasks without requiring additional map detail, and the\nperformance remained smooth due to the reduced file size. The map maintained\nvisual consistency with the application's styling and brand identity.\n\nThis project demonstrates how taking initiative to bridge the gap between design\nrequirements and technical constraints can lead to solutions that meet user\nneeds, business requirements, and brand standards simultaneously.","src/content/projects/03-maas-site-manager.mdx","697d723f5831d787","03-maas-site-manager.mdx",true,"canonicals-figma-libraries",{"id":32,"data":34,"body":43,"filePath":44,"digest":45,"legacyId":46,"deferredRender":31},{"title":35,"date":15,"slug":32,"excerpt":36,"coverImage":37,"heroLocation":18,"asciiDarken":38,"stats":39},"Canonicals Figma libraries","How I rebuilt Canonicals Figma libraries, with practical guidelines on structure, performance, and maintenance processes.","/images/projects/canonical-figma-libraries/figma-components-cover.webp",0.89,[40,42],{"label":22,"value":41},"2024",{"label":25,"value":26},"The shoemaker's children have no shoes. At Canonical's design team, this proverb\nhas manifested itself in the Figma libraries. While the team consistently\ndelivered high-quality designs for diverse products used by millions of users,\nthe Figma libraries had been neglected. They had become outdated and\ninefficient. The decision was made to tackle this problem by developing new\nFigma libraries from scratch. Ones that would meet the team's needs and are\nenjoyable to use.\n\nThe libraries were disorganized and contained material that was still under\ndevelopment, so it was unclear what should be used. Compared to the codebase,\nthey were incomplete, and the existing components were not consistently kept up\nto date. This led to team members detaching components and creating their own\nlocal components and small unofficial libraries, which caused major confusion in\nthe handover process.\n\n## Understanding the problem\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"left\"\n    src=\"/images/projects/canonical-figma-libraries/figma-library-user-survey.webp\"\n    alt=\"Survey form titled 'Figma library update survey' with questions about component usage experience and finding specific components in the design system\"\n>\nAt some point it became clear that\nenough was enough. The team needed to do some self-care and build Figma libraries\nfrom scratch that met the requirements of the usual design work.\n\nInstead of diving in headfirst, the process started by aligning on how to\nstructure the libraries and what rules and methods to follow when creating\ncomponents. I surveyed how designers use components, gathered feedback on\nproblematic components in the old libraries and organized meetings with the team\nto understand their needs. Within this process, I took the initiative to lead\nthe rebuilding effort and draft the initial spec that would guide the work.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Research and specification\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"right\"\n    content={\n        \u003CDocumentSkeleton\n            title=\"Library architecture specification\"\n            lines={20}\n            className=\"max-w-sm\"\n            metadata={[\n                { label: \"Author:\", value: \"Design team\" },\n                { label: \"Date:\", value: \"March 2024\" },\n                { label: \"Version:\", value: \"2.3\" },\n                { label: \"Status:\", value: \"Approved\" }\n            ]}\n        />\n    }\n>\n\nThis involved extensive investigation into best practices for building scalable\nlibraries. I explored approaches from other design teams like\n[Doctolib](https://medium.com/doctolib/how-we-organise-our-design-system-libraries-to-help-doctolib-designers-use-more-than-70-000-c15237c81f6c)\nand articles on\n[library architecture](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/figma-shared-libraries-d2dfbf9d1b8d)\nby Nathan Curtis, particularly his concepts on\n[design system tiers](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/design-system-tiers-2c827b67eae1)\nand how they could apply to the diverse product ecosystem that Canonical has.\n\nTo ensure broad acceptance and create the most effective specification possible,\nI organized review sessions where team members could discuss, modify, and\nultimately approve each section. We went through the entire document together,\ndebating different approaches to component organization, performance\noptimization, and contribution processes. This collaborative approach resulted\nin a thorough 20-page specification with strong team buy-in, creating a solid\nfoundation for the implementation phase.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Implementation\n\n![Figma design interface showing button component variants with different states (Text, Icon, etc.) and color combinations (orange, green, red) in a grid layout, plus changelog section showing recent updates to button components](/images/projects/canonical-figma-libraries/figma-button-component-variants.webp)\n\nWith the specification approved, we moved to implementation. I led the building\nprocess with support from junior designers. I personally built a lot of the\ncomponents, ensuring they followed the established performance guidelines\nregarding layer count, asset optimization, and effect usage. You can read more\nabout the specific building strategies I applied in the\n[blog post I wrote about it](/blog/figma-libraries).\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"left\"\n    content={\n        \u003CMetricsMockup className=\"max-w-md\" />\n    }\n>\n\nBefore releasing the libraries more widely, I recognized that better metrics\nwere needed than what Figma natively provided to properly track adoption and\nidentify improvement opportunities. Figma's built-in analytics were insufficient\nfor the team's needs, so I developed a custom metrics tool, taking inspiration\nfrom approaches shared by the Pinterest and Uber design teams in their public\nmaterials. This custom tooling allowed the team to track critical data points\nsuch as component usage frequency, library adoption rates across teams, and\ncomponent detachment rates. The detachment rates were particularly valuable.\nThey helped identify which components designers were frequently modifying. A\nclear signal that these components needed improvement in the official library.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Transition and adoption\n\nAfter completing the initial library, an internal transition period was\nannounced during which both the old and new libraries would remain available.\nDesigners were encouraged to start using the new components immediately while\nbeing provided enough time to adapt to the changes. The old libraries were\nclearly marked as deprecated with notices in file names, page names, component\nnames, and descriptions, along with links to the new libraries. Throughout this\ntransition, the metrics tool provided valuable insights into adoption patterns,\nhelping us identify which teams were quickly embracing the new system and which\nmight need additional support.\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"relative mx-auto md:-mx-6 lg:-mx-8 xl:-mx-28 my-8 transition duration-700 ease-in-out hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:rotate-[0.2deg] hover:transform-gpu\">\n    \u003Ca\n        href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1435297834108003391/vanilla-core-component-library\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n    >\n        \u003Cimg\n            className=\"w-full h-auto rounded-lg transition duration-700 ease-in-out hover:scale-[1.01]\"\n            src=\"/images/projects/canonical-figma-libraries/figma-community-showcase.webp\"\n            alt=\"Figma Community showcase page for Vanilla Core Component Library with preview thumbnails showing various UI components, statistics showing 4.8K views and 79 duplicates\"\n        />\n    \u003C/a>\n\u003C/div>\n\nBy the end of the transition period, the metrics showed strong adoption across\nthe team. The detachment rates for components in the new library were down\ncompared to the old library. These metrics gave the team confidence that the\nlibraries were thoroughly tested in real design workflows and ready for public\nrelease.\n\n## Public release\n\nThe work was shared with the wider design community by releasing the core\ncomponent library and assets library to the\n[Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1435297834108003391/vanilla-core-component-library).","src/content/projects/02-canonicals-figma-libraries.mdx","3a03ba7f82ac3573","02-canonicals-figma-libraries.mdx","talk",{"id":47,"data":49,"body":59,"filePath":60,"digest":61,"legacyId":62,"deferredRender":31},{"title":50,"date":51,"slug":47,"excerpt":52,"coverImage":53,"heroLocation":18,"stats":54},"Talk","01.12.2022","A presentation tool that automatically navigates and formats content based on spoken words, aiming to solve \"Death by PowerPoint\".","/images/projects/talk/nasa-hero-image.webp",[55,57],{"label":22,"value":56},"2021",{"label":25,"value":58},"Bachelor Thesis","import { Suspense } from \"react\"\nimport {\n    TalkExplanationAnimation,\n    TalkHeroAnimation,\n} from \"../../components/Talk\"\n\n## Problem\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n  src=\"/images/projects/talk/nasa-presentation.webp\"\n  alt=\"NASA PowerPoint slide from Columbia accident investigation showing complex risk assessment data in poorly formatted bullet points, demonstrating ineffective presentation design that contributed to communication failures\"\n  caption=\"PowerPoint Slide as seen in the report of the Nasa accident investigation committee.\"\n>\n\nFor my bachelor's thesis, I wanted to tackle a problem I had experienced\ncountless times throughout university: the numbing feeling of sitting through\nendless PowerPoint presentations. This phenomenon is often called _\"Death by\nPowerPoint\"_. Presentations where audience interest dies through poor slide\ndesign and rigid navigation alone. Edward Tufte, a renowned data visualization\nexpert, even assigned partial blame for the Columbia space shuttle disaster to\nineffective PowerPoint communication in NASA's risk assessment processes.\n\nWhile most presentations don't have life-or-death consequences, poor\npresentation tools still create inefficient communication cultures plagued by\ninattention, misunderstandings, and wasted time and energy.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n\u003CSuspense>\n    \u003CTalkHeroAnimation />\n\u003C/Suspense>\n\nI began exploring what a presentation tool might look like if it supported\ntoday's dynamic, flexible communication styles. The ideal scenario would allow\npresenters to speak naturally and engage with their audience without worrying\nabout navigating slides or managing layouts.\n\nThis led me to develop Talk, a presentation system that automatically handles\nnavigation and visual structure based on spoken content. The core concept:\nduring a presentation, the system records what you say through a microphone and\nautomatically displays, arranges, and animates the appropriate visualizations\nbased on your words.\n\n## How it works\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    content={\n        \u003CSuspense>\n            \u003CTalkExplanationAnimation />\n            \u003Cfigcaption>\n                Connecting paragraphs of the script with visualizations.\n            \u003C/figcaption>\n        \u003C/Suspense>\n    }\n>\n\nTalk works differently from traditional presentation software by requiring a\nscript during setup. This script can consist of complete sentences or meaningful\nkeywords, with each passage linked to specific visualizations.\n\nDuring the presentation, you speak naturally while the system records and\nanalyzes your words. The software compares what you say with your script\npassages using semantic content analysis (not simple keyword matching). This\nmeans you don't need to speak the exact scripted words, the system understands\nmeaning and context.\n\nI was particularly interested in how Talk could translate linguistic emphasis\ninto visual hierarchy. When we speak, we naturally use sentiment, emphasis, and\nfigures of speech to convey importance. The system analyzes these speech\npatterns and translates them into corresponding visual elements. Automatically\ncreating emphasis and de-emphasis in the presentation that aligns with what\nyou're saying.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\nFor example, if one were to say during a presentation:\n\n> We are going to implement X and Y. However, implementing Y is still a long way\n> off.\n\nIn the presentation, X would remain in the foreground and Y would move to the\nbackground.\n\n## Technical implementation\n\nThe core challenge was building a system that could understand and respond to\nnatural speech in real-time. I built a prototype of Talk using machine learning\nalgorithms, specifically\n[Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)\ntechniques for processing spoken language.\n\nThe system relied on three key NLP capabilities:\n[Speech-to-Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) for\nconverting speech to text,\n[Semantic Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity) for\nmatching spoken content with scripted passages, and\n[Document Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification)\nfor analyzing sentiment and emphasis patterns.\n\n## Results\n\nThe system I developed represented a fundamentally different approach to\npresentations compared to existing slide-based tools on the market. By\nautomatically generating both visual structure and navigation based on spoken\ncontent, Talk addressed several key limitations of traditional presentation\nsoftware.\n\n- Presenters could address audience questions instantly without needing to\n  navigate to specific slides first\n- No need to remain tethered to a laptop for slide advancement\n- Reduced temptation to read directly from slides, encouraging more engaging\n  presentation styles\n- Eliminated the need to manually create slide layouts, preventing common issues\n  like overcrowded slides with excessive bullet points","src/content/projects/06-talk.mdx","ff58c7f04393003b","06-talk.mdx","protostar",{"id":63,"data":65,"body":73,"filePath":74,"digest":75,"legacyId":76,"deferredRender":31},{"title":66,"date":15,"slug":63,"excerpt":67,"coverImage":68,"heroLocation":18,"asciiDarken":69,"stats":70},"Proto*","While doing user research for one of Canonicals CLIs I realised there are no good tools for prototyping and user testing CLIs.

And so was MAAS (Metal as a Service) the\nproduct I was working on at the time. Especially if you want to deploy MAAS in\nhigh-availability (HA) (setting up 3 identical installations so if one fails\nanother one can take over) things can become tricky. Thats why the MAAS team\nworked on a CLI tool that makes installing MAAS in HA easier: MAAS Anvil. The\nteam was preparing MAAS Anvil for a Beta release and wanted to identify any\nsignificant usability gaps beforehand. There was also interest in understanding\nbetter how best to add new features being considered, which had several\nimplementation options, but it wasn't certain which experience would work best\nfor users.\n\n\u003CFanImages\n    images={[\n        {\n            src: \"/images/projects/protostar/user-testing-setup-instructions.webp\",\n            alt: \"User testing setup instructions document explaining how to prepare machines for MAAS Anvil testing, including Ubuntu 22.04 LTS requirements and network configuration\",\n        },\n        {\n            src: \"/images/projects/protostar/user-interview-guide.webp\",\n            alt: \"Interview guide document with sections for general questions, installation and deployment process, including specific prompts about user workflows and pain points\",\n        },\n        {\n            src: \"/images/projects/protostar/maas-anvil-research-brief.webp\",\n            alt: \"MAAS Anvil research brief with Jira ticket information, background context, goals including finding usability issues and proposing solutions, plus research plan checkboxes\",\n        },\n    ]}\n    caption=\"Research preparation documents outlining study objectives and methodology\"\n/>\n\nI began by creating a comprehensive research brief outlining the purpose of the\nstudy, the assumptions that needed to be tested, and my methodology. After\nsharing this with the team to ensure alignment on research objectives, I\ndeveloped an interview guide that would help understand user behaviors and\npreferences. During this process, I realized that testing different feature\nimplementation options would require some form of prototype.\n\n## User testing CLIs\n\nBut the problem is that there aren't any good options for prototyping and user\ntesting command-line interfaces. Figma prototypes were inadequate because users\ncouldn't type actual commands, only click through predetermined paths. Simply\nreviewing command structures in a document failed to provide the interaction\ndepth of a real CLI experience. And while coding a functioning CLI would be\ntechnically possible, it would require participants to install software before\ninterviews. An immediate barrier when working with system administrators who are\nunderstandably skeptical about installing unknown packages on their systems.\nIdeally, the solution would be as frictionless as Figma prototypes, where\nresearchers can simply send a link to participants.\n\nThis prompted me to hack together a CLI prototyping tool on my own on a friday\nafternoon. I knew about [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/), a terminal library\nused by established apps like Visual Studio Code. I used it and other libraries\nto build a prototype that emulated a terminal environment entirely in the\nbrowser, with no installation required.\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"left\"\n    src=\"/images/projects/protostar/juju-cli-user-testing-session.webp\"\n    alt=\"Screen recording of a user testing session showing terminal interface with Juju commands for vault deployment, with participant's face visible in small window overlay during remote testing session\"\n>\n    Despite the prototype being a bit buggy, it worked remarkably well in user\n    research sessions. It allowed participants to interact with the CLI\n    naturally by typing commands, exploring different paths, and providing\n    feedback on the various implementation options being considered. The quality\n    of user insights was substantially better than what could have been achieved\n    through static mockups or theoretical discussions.\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Sharing user insights\n\n\u003CFanImages\n    images={[\n        {\n            src: \"/images/projects/protostar/maas-anvil-improvement-suggestions.webp\",\n            alt: \"Research suggestions document with categories for Docs, Help messages, Flags/prompts, Manifest, Vault, and Newgrp snapdaemon, showing specific improvement recommendations for each area\",\n        },\n        {\n            src: \"/images/projects/protostar/usability-research-key-takeaways.webp\",\n            alt: \"Key takeaways table with columns for Learnability, Efficiency, Error Tolerant, and Security, showing findings for MAAS Anvil features like Sunbeam integration, VIP configuration, and Vault management with color-coded insights\",\n        },\n    ]}\n    caption=\"Research preparation documents outlining study objectives and methodology\"\n/>\n\nAfter having done the interviews I started to analyze them. Looking for research\ntrends across all interviews etc. Once I found some trends and insights I put\nthem into a UX heuristics matrix to make the different insights easier to\ncommunicate to stakeholders. Once having the UX heuristics insights I compiled\nmore concrete suggestions in how to proceed with improving the tool and adding\nnew features. I presented all of this to my stakeholders in a meeting. The\nresearch and the suggestions were received well and the team looked into how to\nfix the identified issues.\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"left\"\n    src=\"/images/projects/protostar/anvil-documentation.webp\"\n    alt=\"Documentation interface showing CLI tool help and usage instructions with command examples and parameter descriptions\"\n>\n    One of the biggest insights of the research was that the documentation of\n    the tool (including help messages in the CLI) was not yet where it needed to\n    be for users to confidently use the tool.

Protostar\n    has already gained traction among designers at Canonical who need to test\n    CLI interfaces. It also got some attention when it was mentioned during a\n    presentation on CLI design at FOSDEM by one of Canonicals Design directors,\n    generating interest from the open-source community. What began as a\n    practical solution to a specific research challenge has evolved into a\n    specialized tool that fills a genuine gap in the UX design toolkit,\n    particularly for those working with command-line interfaces.\n\u003C/FloatImage>","src/content/projects/05-protostar.mdx","4e0e73155d1c673b","05-protostar.mdx","canonicals-design-tokens",{"id":77,"data":79,"body":87,"filePath":88,"digest":89,"legacyId":90,"deferredRender":31},{"title":80,"date":15,"slug":77,"excerpt":81,"coverImage":82,"heroLocation":18,"asciiDarken":38,"stats":83},"Canonical Design tokens","Initiated and led design tokens at Canonical.

It lacked features that modern design systems have,\nincluding a systematic approach to visual foundations. Visual foundations\nexisted most often as SCSS variables but sometimes they were also hard-coded\ndirectly into the components. At the same time, other teams had started\nimplementing their own interpretations of Vanilla in Flutter, and there was a\nFigma library which was supposed to mirror Vanilla components. This situation\nmade it quite manual and error-prone to ensure that these other platforms\nvisually matched our source of truth as there was no way for them to interface\nwith the visual foundations of the CSS library directly.\n\nCanonical also recently changed its logo and its official typeface (from\n[Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) to\n[Ubuntu Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Sans)), and the fact that\nthe old logo and typeface can still be found in various places across\nCanonical's presence shows that Canonical lacks the infrastructure to\nefficiently implement these branding and visual changes across Canonical's\nportfolio.\n\n## Modernizing the design system\n\nIt was clear that what was needed was a centralized and systematic approach to\nvisual foundations. In essence, Canonical needed Design tokens and I pushed for\nand led this effort to create these Design tokens.\n\n![Spreadsheet showing design token inventory with columns for 'Vanilla variable', 'CTI', 'Light', 'Paper', and 'Dark', displaying various color tokens like color-positive, color-negative, color-information, and their corresponding RGBA values across different themes](/images/projects/canonical-design-tokens/tokens-inventory-audit.webp)\n\nI started by creating an inventory of existing variables and their flows from\nvariables to actual usage in components. This approach, suggested by\n[Nathan Curtis in his writing on the topic](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/reimagining-a-token-taxonomy-462d35b2b033),\nmade sense for understanding the current needs of our design system and its\nusers. I had a head start on this task since I had recently built\n[new Figma libraries for Canonical](/projects/canonicals-figma-libraries), which\nrequired, amongst other things, extracting all visual information from the\nsource code. I was able to use this as a foundation for the inventory and flows\nand so I quickly gained an understanding of the existing needs.\n\n## Research and Specification\n\nWhile conducting this inventory, I performed extensive research on design\ntokens. Despite their seemingly straightforward nature, implementing design\ntokens properly is surprisingly complex. A significant portion of the challenge\nlies in establishing naming conventions, a notoriously difficult and often\ncontentious process in larger organizations.\n\nSince design tokens are fundamentally about creating a shared language for\nvisual properties, getting the naming right is critical to their success.\nWorking with another designer, we began drafting a specification for how to\nstructure and name design tokens at Canonical.\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"right\"\n    content={\n        \u003CDocumentSkeleton\n            title=\"Design tokens specification\"\n            lines={18}\n            className=\"max-w-sm\"\n            metadata={[\n                { label: \"Author:\", value: \"Design team\" },\n                { label: \"Date:\", value: \"September 2024\" },\n                { label: \"Version:\", value: \"1.1\" },\n                { label: \"Status:\", value: \"Approved\" }\n            ]}\n        />\n    }\n>\n\nI had seen great success with a collaborative format when creating the\n[Figma libraries](/projects/canonicals-figma-libraries), where I created an\ninitial specification and then held several discussion meetings with the wider\nteam and stakeholders. I applied the same approach to design tokens. After\ncreating an initial specification draft, I invited the team to several\ndiscussion meetings where we went through all sections of the specification\nuntil we had something everyone was happy with.\n\nThrough this collaborative process, we reached agreement on the taxonomy for\ndesign tokens at Canonical, covering naming conventions, token organization, and\nprocesses for storing and updating them.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Implementation\n\nWith the inventory, research, and taxonomy complete, it was time to actually\ncreate the tokens. This involved understanding current needs from the inventory\nwhile also being forward looking about future requirements for the design system\nas we were looking to generally modernize the design system and make it more\nscaleable. So while working on design tokens I was not only looking to translate\nour current visual foundations into a Design token framework but take the\nopportunity and adopt a more systematic approach to visual foundations.\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"left\"\n    content={\n        \u003CColorPaletteMockup className=\"min-w-md max-w-lg\" />\n    }\n>\n\nFor colors for example, we previously didn't have a proper UI palette. Colors\nwere added on an as needed basis. I wanted to use the color token work as an\nopportunity to move to a more systematic approach. I created a palette based on\n[Matthew Ström's article about how to create color palettes for design systems](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/generating-color-palettes/)\nwhere he describes an approach where you do not create shades based on lightness\nbut based on contrast between shades (which makes creating accessible color\ncombinations easier).\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\nAt the time of writing, I had created primitive dimension tokens, primitive and\nsemantic typography tokens, and was almost finished with the color tokens. With\nplans to work on semantic dimension tokens and smaller token categories such as\nasset tokens next.\n\n## Result\n\nEngineering had not yet moved to implementing design tokens, but I was curious\nabout what the implementation would actually look like in real world scenarios.\nI'm always interested in understanding how things work, and I was particularly\ndrawn to the work the\n[W3C Design Tokens Working Group](https://www.designtokens.org/tr/drafts/format/)\nwas doing. I wanted to get hands-on experience with\n[Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/) to understand its capabilities\nand limitations, and how different tooling choices would affect our token\nauthoring process. This exploration turned out to be valuable. I discovered\nseveral implementation limitations that I was able to feed back into the token\nauthoring process before engineering began their full implementation.\n\nBelow is the code of my prototype with a Style dictionary build system in the\n`/build` folder, CSS and Figma\n([tokens.studio for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/tokens-studio-for-figma))\noutput in the `/dist` folder and some of the tokens we had created to this point\nin the `/tokens` folder.\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"relative mx-auto my-8 md:-mx-6 lg:-mx-8 xl:-mx-28\">\n    \u003CGitHubCodeExplorer\n        owner=\"dgtlntv\"\n        repo=\"design-tokens-reference\"\n        className=\"min-h-[500px]\"\n        defaultPath=\"README.md\"\n    />\n\u003C/div>\n\nOnce engineering moves to full implementation and adoption across platforms,\nCanonical's visual foundations will be more systematic and platforms more\naligned, creating a scalable foundation that will support the design system as\nit continues to mature.","src/content/projects/04-canonicals-design-tokens.mdx","6593515fab3c694b","04-canonicals-design-tokens.mdx","mlrug",{"id":91,"data":93,"body":104,"filePath":105,"digest":106,"legacyId":107,"deferredRender":31},{"title":94,"date":95,"slug":91,"excerpt":96,"coverImage":97,"heroLocation":98,"stats":99},"MLRUG","01.01.2019","Experimented with generative algorithms to create Moroccan carpet designs, then brought them to life through traditional production in Morocco.

However, these discussions\nwere all theoretical in nature, and I wanted to explore what that would mean in\npractice. I wanted to carry out a project in which I experimented with\ngenerative algorithms as a design tool, which led to a year-long experiment that\nlasted from my time at university until today.\n\n## Data Collection\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"right\"\n    content={\n        \u003CImageGallery \n            images={[\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/input-data-1.webp\", alt: \"Traditional Moroccan carpet with intricate geometric patterns featuring warm earth tones\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/input-data-2.webp\", alt: \"Vintage Moroccan carpet displaying complex tribal patterns in deep blues and reds\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/input-data-3.webp\", alt: \"Handwoven Moroccan carpet with distinctive diamond and cross motifs in natural wool colors\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/input-data-4.webp\", alt: \"Traditional Berber carpet featuring bold geometric compositions and earthy color palette\" },\n               ]}\n        />\n    }\n>\n\nI started this project a couple of years before many of the impressive AI tools\n([Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion),\n[VEO](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/),\n[GPT-5](https://openai.com/de-DE/index/introducing-gpt-5/), etc.) we have today\nexisted. The only realistic way for me to conduct this experiment was to train\nmy own algorithm (based on other people's algorithms, of course).\n\nAs with so many projects in the field of machine learning, one of the most\nimportant considerations for me was the question of what data I would feed into\nmy generative algorithm. I wanted to choose a design object that I was\nreasonably familiar with, for which I could obtain a sufficient amount of data,\nand that could be represented as an image (since 3D generative design is much\nmore difficult). Based on these considerations, I opted for Moroccan carpets. I\nam very familiar with Moroccan carpets because my father trades with them, which\nalso gives me access to image data of Moroccan carpets. I supplemented the data\nI was able to obtain from my father with images from the internet, which I\ncollected using a web crawler. In the end, I was able to obtain about 3.000\nimages of Moroccan carpets. This is not a huge amount in the context of a\ngenerative algorithm, but enough to get first reasonably useful results.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Algorithm and Computing\n\nI investigated various architectures and algorithms and finally settled on\n[HyperGAN](https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN). At the time, it was an\nappropriately powerful architecture for this project and was specifically\ndesigned to lower the barrier to entry for artists and designers. For my first\ntest, I ran [HyperGAN](https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN) on my laptop, but I\nquickly realized that my laptop's graphics card (GTX1050) would not be\nsufficient for a full run.\n\nSo I turned to cloud solutions. In the process, I landed on\n[Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/), which is based on DigitalOcean (afaik\nit was AWS then) but offers a simpler user experience and is optimized for\nmachine learning. There, I did a number of different training runs with my data,\nusing different resolutions and parameters. In the end, I found that\n[HyperGAN](https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN)'s default parameters and a\nresolution of 256x256 worked best for me.\n\n## Initial Results\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"left\"\n    content={\n        \u003CImageGallery\n            images={[\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-first-iteration-1.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Sample 1 of blurry but recognizable AI generated moroccan rug\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-first-iteration-2.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Sample 2 of blurry but recognizable AI generated moroccan rug\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-first-iteration-3.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Sample 3 of blurry but recognizable AI generated moroccan rug\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-first-iteration-4.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Sample 4 of blurry but recognizable AI generated moroccan rug\",\n                },\n            ]}\n        />\n    }\n>\n    I wouldn't call the results perfect, but for the amount of data and\n    technical knowledge I had at the time, I think they were reasonable. At this\n    point, it's clear that training an algorithm on a small scale like this\n    isn't really going to replace a designer's design process. But it can serve\n    as inspiration. And it definitely did in this project.\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## From Digital to Physical\n\nWhen I first experimented with generative adversarial networks (GANs) in 2019, I\nachieved only moderate results. However, the results improved significantly when\nI revisited this project together with my sister Ida, who was working on her\nmaster's thesis on the historical pattern development in Moroccan carpets. We\nwanted to explore the parallels between traditional carpet pattern development\nand AI pattern development processes. Traditional carpet patterns evolved\nthrough geographical migration across the Mediterranean, blending influences\nfrom diverse cultures including the Berbers, Arab nomads, Moorish Andalusians,\nand Ottomans. We're interested in comparing this analog, cross-cultural pattern\nevolution with the digital pattern development processes used by AI systems. Our\ngoal was to investigate whether the machine learning approach to pattern\ngeneration can be viewed through the same lens as the centuries-old tradition of\nmotifs that have developed and spread from urban manufactories to rural\ncommunities and back again.\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"right\"\n    content={\n        \u003CImageGallery\n            images={[\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed0035.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern featuring vibrant blue and orange geometric patterns with central diamond motifs\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed0552.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern with intricate tribal motifs in warm earth tones\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed2705.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern displaying bold geometric compositions with natural color palette\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed3733.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern featuring symmetrical patterns and traditional color schemes\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed3948.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern with complex tribal motifs and rich color variations\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed4222.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern incorporating traditional diamond and cross motifs with contemporary color interpretation\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed5014.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern featuring flowing organic patterns and warm color palettes\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-generated-rug-design-seed5151.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Machine learning generated rug pattern with sophisticated geometric patterns and balanced color composition\"\n                },\n            ]}\n        />\n    }\n>\n\nFor this second iteration of the project I reevaluated which algorithm to use\nand landed on StyleGAN2-ada, a variant specifically designed for training with\nfewer images. Using my father's high-quality photo archive again and this time\nsupplemented by much more carefully selected internet images, we achieved much\nbetter results than in my first iteration. Showing how much machine learning had\nevolved in such a short time (and how much of an effect good quality data can\nhave).\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Production and Collaboration\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"left\"\n    content={\n        \u003CImageGallery \n            images={[\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-1.webp\", alt: \"Traditional Moroccan carpet weaving setup showing colorful yarns and weaving materials scattered on wooden surface\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-2.webp\", alt: \"Close-up view of traditional loom with partially completed carpet\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-4.webp\", alt: \"Artisan hands working on traditional carpet loom\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-5.webp\", alt: \"Traditional weaving workshop environment \" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-6.webp\", alt: \"Detailed view of carpet weaving in progress\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-7.webp\", alt: \"Advanced stage of carpet production showing the emerging geometric patterns\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-11.webp\", alt: \"Final stages of traditional carpet weaving process where they wash it\" },\n                { src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-weaving-production-12.webp\", alt: \"Finished handwoven carpet washed on the floor\" }\n            ]}\n        />\n    }\n>\n\nThe most exciting part of this collaboration with my sister and father was that\nit brought me full circle, returning me to my original curiosity about using\nmachine learning as a tool in the design process by actually bringing these\ndigital creations back into the physical world.\n\nRather than choosing Indian or Nepalese manufactories with their precision\ntechnology that would allow nearly photographic reproduction, we deliberately\nopted for production in Morocco. The rhizomatic producer landscape there\nconsisting of many small, interconnected local businesses allowed us to maintain\nthe character and vitality of the original designs while ensuring value creation\nremained in the country that inspired our work.\n\nWorking with a producer from the western Middle Atlas that my father had\ncollaborated with for several years, we were able to translate the\nalgorithmically generated designs into handcrafted rugs. The result was not a\nmechanical reproduction but rather a living interpretation that preserved the\nimprovisational qualities that make Moroccan rugs special.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Exhibition & trade magazine features\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    direction=\"right\"\n    content={\n        \u003CImageGallery\n            images={[\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-1.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-2.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-3.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-4.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-6.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-7.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-8.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\",\n                },\n                {\n                    src: \"/images/projects/mlrug/ml-rug-gallery-exhibition-11.webp\",\n                    alt: \"Gallery exhibition view showing the produced carpets hung on a wall.\"\n                },\n            ]}\n        />\n    }\n>\n\nThese algorithmically generated, curated and handcrafted rugs were presented as\npart of [Design Month Graz 2025](https://www.designmonat.at/en/event/mlrug/).\n\nThe project gained recognition beyond the exhibition, being featured in two\narticles in Cover, a leading publication in handmade carpets and textiles for\ninteriors.\n\nThis coverage positioned MLRug within important industry conversations about the\nintersection of traditional craft and emerging technology.

With\nthis article, I simply want to draw attention to a problem that has been hardly\ndiscussed in Blockchain — the accessibility of Blockchain applications. Some\naspects of blockchain are rather inaccessible, and in this article, I would like\nto point out the ones that stood out to me.\n\n## Designing for Accessibility\n\n### Intro\n\nIn general, the goal when designing for accessibility is to increase the\nusability of the application for all people, but especially for those with\ndisabilities. In the end, all people should be able to perceive, understand,\nnavigate, and interact with the application.\n\nDesigning for accessibility includes considering all disabilities that may limit\nease of interaction with an application:\n\n- Visual\n- Motor/mobility\n- Auditory\n- Seizures\n- Learning/cognitive\n\nThere are also many situational limitations where accessible applications\nprovide a better user experience to both people with physical or mental\ndisabilities and those without. **Strong sunlight**, **lost optical glasses**,\nor even a **too-small screen** can lead to visual limitations. Temporary\nconditions like a **broken arm** or a **broken touchscreen** lead to tactile\nrestrictions. Finally, even something as common as **sleep deprivation** can\nlead to minor mental impairments.\n\nThis means that designing for accessibility not only benefits people with\ndisabilities but also leads to significantly better user experiences for\neveryone.\n\n### How to Design for Accessibility?\n\nThere are many resources that can help you get started with designing (and\ndeveloping) for accessibility. One which I can highly recommend is the\naccessibility section of the Material Guidelines from Google. It is a thorough\nlist of the most important things to consider when designing for accessibility.\n[1](#1)\n\nRight at the beginning, this guide lists 3 pillars according to which one should\ndesign for accessibility, namely:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"article-grid\">\n    \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003Cstrong>Clear\u003C/strong>\n        \u003Cbr>\u003C/br>Help users navigate by designing clear layouts with distinct\n        calls to action.\n    \u003C/div>\n\n    \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003Cstrong>Robust\u003C/strong>\n        \u003Cbr>\u003C/br>Design your app to accommodate a variety of users.\n    \u003C/div>\n\n    \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003Cstrong>Specific\u003C/strong>\n        \u003Cbr>\u003C/br>Support assistive technologies specific to your platform, just\n        as you support the input methods of touch, keyboard, and mouse.\n    \u003C/div>\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nThese pillars might still be a bit abstract for many people; therefore I will\nsummarize the most important points of the accessibility guidelines of Google\nhere:\n\n- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.\n- Help users avoid and correct mistakes.\n- Have a clear hierarchy of importance.\n- Make essential information discernable at a glance.\n- Make elements clearly visible.\n- Have sufficient contrast and intentional color selection for accessibility\n  (red-green visual impairment etc.).\n- Support assistive technology on the platform you are developing on.\n    - Alternative text (description of images/illustrations, text for textless\n      buttons etc.)\n        - This allows screen readers to read out all elements of the interface.\n    - Scalable text and a spacious layout to accommodate users who may have\n      large text, color correction, magnification, or other assistive settings\n      turned on.\n    - Keyboard and mouse interfaces can have every task and all hover\n      information available through keyboard-only input.\n    - Allow screen readers and other assistive technology devices to read all\n      parts of your interface.\n\n## Issues\n\nFinally, I would like to focus on the accessibility issues of the blockchain\necosystem in particular. As I am not an accessibility expert, I will not catch\nall of the pain points that people with various disabilities might struggle\nwith. However, I will provide examples of the things I imagine to be essential\nproblems to address.\n\n### Long strings of numbers and letters\n\n\u003CFloatImage src=\"/images/blog/accessibility/eth-wallet-qr-address.webp\" alt=\"Mobile cryptocurrency wallet screen showing 'Receive ETH' interface with a QR code and the Ethereum address '0x73802712969993b1A74a08F326d0eb2e053555C28' displayed below it\" direction=\"left\">\n\nThe first challenge that could arise is the long letter and number combinations\nprevalent in blockchain — frequently found in things like transaction hashes and\nwallet addresses. These could become a problem, especially for people with\nvisual impairments who rely on screen readers. At the moment, the complex\naddresses still play a significant role in the daily use of cryptocurrencies and\nother blockchain applications. Using a screen reader turns to verify a\ntransaction recipient’s already complex wallet address into a near-impossible\ntask. As an example, here is Google's Wavenet, one of the most advanced\ntext-to-speech programs, trying to read out a cryptocurrency address.\n\n\u003Caudio controls>\n    \u003Csource src=\"/audio/accessibility/address.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\u003C/source>\n    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\u003C/audio>\n\nListening to this audio file, it is obvious that checking a wallet address could\nbe problematic.\n\nSince many wallets forward to third-party block-explorers to check the status\nand validity of a transaction, users also often come across other long\nnumber/letter strings such as transaction hashes.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n### Prioritization of QR codes\n\nIn an effort to minimize the UX issue of addresses, many wallets seem to\nprioritize QR codes in their interface. However, this prioritization puts people\nwith visual impairments, who cannot use them, at a clear disadvantage.\n\n### Accessible Hardware wallet\n\nAt the moment, there doesn't seem to be a hardware wallet that is accessible to\nvisually impaired people. As a result, people with visual impairments have been\nprevented from utilizing this more secure option of managing their\ncryptocurrencies.\n\n### Designing for accessibility has not been a priority\n\nFor many flagship wallets and dApps, designing for accessibility doesn't seem to\nbe a priority. From my research, many Blockchain applications don't seem to\nfollow the most basic accessibility rules like contrast, fully supporting\nassistive technology, etc.\n\n### Security Issues\n\nAssistive technologies such as screen readers could prove to be a security\nproblem. On the one hand, these could be compromised by nefarious parties, and\npersonal information such as the mnemonic phrases (secret access code to crypto\nwallets) could be stolen. On the other hand, these technologies could share\nthese secrets accidentally.\n\nFor example, it is conceivable that the mnemonic phrase is unintentionally read\naloud by a screen reader (navigating blockchain apps with assistive technologies\noften works poorly). If this happens in a public context, users would\nunintentionally share their secrets with everyone in their vicinity.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI have a feeling that for many people in blockchain, (financial) inclusion is an\nimportant value that drew them to the space. However, we need to extend this\ninclusion further and make blockchain applications more accessible to people\nwith physical and mental disabilities by designing them to be barrier-free. The\naforementioned problems are far from being unsolvable. On the contrary, some of\nthem seem relatively easy to solve and are even aligned with other UX efforts.\nFor example, the use of ENS names instead of addresses would be a big step in\nthe right direction for visually impaired people since an ENS name is much\neasier for a screen reader to read and less complex for a person to understand\nthan an address.\n\n\u003Caudio controls>\n    \u003Csource src=\"/audio/accessibility/ens.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\u003C/source>\n    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\u003C/audio>\n\nIf these become widespread, QR codes would not have to be prioritized as much.\nThere have already been efforts to create a hardware wallet for visually\nimpaired people, namely the IcyWallet. However, IcyWallet’s development never\nseemed to pass the MVP stage and at the time of publishing this article, the\nIcyWallet website and GitHub repository are offline.\n\nUltimately, what is most important is that software and hardware wallet\ndevelopers are aware of the accessibility issues (and the security issues that\ncould come with it) and are actively working to address them. As I have\nmentioned in previous articles, wallets are one of the primary ways people will\ninteract with blockchain, and it’s no different for people with disabilities.\nTherefore, it is important that both software and hardware wallets are\n**designed to be accessible for everyone**.\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n1:\n\u003Ca name=\"1\" href=\"https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html\">Accessibility,\nMaterial Design\u003C/a>\n\n2:\n\u003Ca name=\"2\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\">Accessibility\nIntroduction, Web Accessibility Initiative\u003C/a>\n\n3:\n\u003Ca name=\"3\" href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility\">Accessibility,\nInteraction Design Foundation\u003C/a>\n\n4:\n\u003Ca name=\"4\" href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/icywallet-offers-a-cold-storage-bitcoin-wallet-for-the-visually-impaired-2017-12-12\">IcyWallet\nOffers a Cold Storage Bitcoin Wallet for the Visually Impaired, Nasdaq, 2017\u003C/a>","src/content/blog/accessibility.mdx","53edeb5e09848517","accessibility.mdx","first-crypto",{"id":122,"data":124,"body":128,"filePath":129,"digest":130,"legacyId":131,"deferredRender":31},{"title":125,"date":114,"slug":122,"excerpt":126,"coverImage":127,"author":117},"Your First Crypto","On-ramp and off-ramp services are a way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money quickly and easily. They provide an essential service because they significantly lower the barrier to entry for inexperienced users. Without these services, inexperienced users would be overwhelmed with the interfaces and interactions required to buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange.","/images/blog/first-crypto/wrapped-dollar-bill-crypto.webp","One of the first steps you will take when beginning to interact with blockchain\nis to get cryptocurrencies (possibly even before you create a wallet). Without\nCryptocurrencies, you can hardly do anything on the blockchain. Consequently,\nthe process of getting your first cryptocurrency is a critical step in\nonboarding new users. The UX has to ensure that this initial important step is\npleasant and easy for everyone to do. In extension, it's just as important to be\nable to convert your cryptocurrencies back into fiat currency, because sometimes\nyou need to buy things in everyday life.\n\nThat's why in this article, I'll take a closer look at the process of new users\nreceiving their first cryptocurrencies, as well as how they can sell them back\nfor fiat currency.\n\n## Ways to get Crypto\n\nAs many already know, there are two main ways to get cryptocurrencies.\n\n### Mining / Staking\n\nDepending on the blockchain’s technical structure, you can receive a specific\ncryptocurrency from a particular blockchain by either mining or staking.  Mining\nand staking mechanisms are how new tokens are brought into circulation. Mining\nand staking are, of course, rather advanced activities. So, it is not likely\nthat someone will receive their first crypto by mining.\n\nThat's why we are now going to look at the second way: buying them.\n\n### Buying\n\nThere are several different ways to buy crypto, but the two most relevant to\nthis article are buying on exchanges and buying through ramp services.\n\n#### Exchange\n\nAt the moment, most people still buy their first cryptocurrencies on exchanges,\ndespite the fact that exchanges are relatively complex products that require a\nlot of customer understanding (KYC). Exchanges are relatively complex products\nbecause exchanges are predominantly designed as a special tool for people who\ninvest. In my opinion, this is why most people currently purchase their first\ncryptos on exchanges—because the most common use case for crypto at the moment\nis investments. People tolerate these complex interfaces because they are\nwilling to spend some time to learn the tool they are using to invest. However,\nas more use-cases arise beyond investing, more people who are not willing to\ninvest time learning how to use investing tools, will come into contact with\nblockchain and crypto.\n\nAs a result of the diversity of crypto users, there is another product category\nfor buying cryptocurrencies: ramp services.\n\n#### Ramp Services\n\nTheoretically, an exchange could also be called a ramp service. Since, strictly\nspeaking, the term, ‘ramp service’ only refers to the process of buying\ncryptocurrencies with fiat money. However, the term is often used for a type of\nproduct that greatly simplifies the process of buying crypto.\n\nTypically,  ramp service  interfaces are nowhere near as complex as those of\nexchanges, and their KYC requirements are usually tiered according to how much a\ncustomer wants to purchase. If you want to buy very little, the KYC process is\nminimal and the whole process will be much easier and faster.\n\nFor example, popular ramp services include:\n\n- simplex\n- ramp.network\n- wyre\n- mercuryo\n\n\u003CFloatImage src=\"/images/blog/first-crypto/mercuryo-crypto-exchange.webp\" alt=\"Mercuryo exchange interface showing 'Buy and sell crypto' with USD to ETH conversion, displaying a long crypto address and payment options\" direction=\"right\">\n  Many wallets have provided on-ramp services in their platforms so that users do not have to go out of their way to buy crypto. However, most wallets only redirect to an on-ramp service, which then opens in a new browser window (as for example the Trust Wallet does in the screenshot shown).\n\nIn my opinion, this is not an optimal solution. It is already difficult to build\ntrust for crypto products as many people are inherently skeptical. Being\nredirected to another website in order to make a purchase, often without an\nexplanation why, undoubtedly deters some people from actually going through with\nthe purchase, because they are not sure if they can trust the website they have\nbeen redirected to.\n\nIt would be much better if the entire buying process happened in the wallet app,\nand the transaction with the ramp provider worked in the background, hidden from\nthe user.\n\nWith most ramp services, there is a relatively large selection of popular\ncryptocurrencies that one can purchase. However, not all of them are available,\nof course. In addition, ramp services support significantly fewer\ncryptocurrencies when converting back to fiat currencies. When ramp services\noffer users to sell cryptocurrencies, they often only support bitcoin and\nethereum.\n\nFor blockchain protocols that are looking to develop use-cases beyond investing,\nit is important that they make their cryptocurrency simple to buy, i.e., with a\nramp service. However, they should also prioritize simple solutions to easily\nsell this cryptocurrency as well. Without a simple ramp services solution for\nselling crypto, users will have to go to an exchange to sell. Again, this would\nrun the risk that less technically experienced people would avoid the\ncryptocurrency altogether. When a currency is too complex for average people to\nconvert into fiat, it becomes worthless in “real world use”, because users can’t\neasily use it to purchase things they need in “real life”.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\u003CFloatImage src=\"/images/blog/first-crypto/crypto-kyc-form.webp\" alt=\"Mobile crypto purchase KYC form titled 'Enter basic details' with fields for first name, last name, date of birth, and country of nationality\" direction=\"right\">\n  It is still very common for people to buy their first cryptocurrencies on an exchange. However, one should not expect that all users will be willing to do so in the future, especially as use-cases outside of investing become more prevalent. Therefore, all blockchain protocols should seek out ramp services to support their cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is great that so many wallets already have onramp services built into their\nproduct. However, I think there is still much room for improvement. Wallets\nshould not redirect users to an external website. Instead, they should do\neverything within their own app (as the ZenGo Wallet does in this example). This\nchange would be a significant step toward a smoother experience for users.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>","src/content/blog/first-crypto.mdx","82c541c7cb7ff176","first-crypto.mdx","jargon",{"id":132,"data":134,"body":138,"filePath":139,"digest":140,"legacyId":141,"deferredRender":31},{"title":135,"date":114,"slug":132,"excerpt":136,"coverImage":137,"author":117},"Jargon","Jargon is the specific terminology associated with a particular field or area of activity. It is well documented that jargon can have a negative impact on communication between professionals and laypeople. When niche words and phrases are used in applications that are intended for first time users, these unfamiliar words become meaningless jargon that provides no value. It clouds and complicates meaning, which is irritating and alienating to users, with potentially harmful consequences to all parties.","/images/blog/jargon/jargon-word-cloud.webp","## What is Jargon\n\nJargon is specific terminology associated with a particular domain. It is\nessential to describe new entities for which there is no name yet, and it\nensures the lingual precision and accuracy required for some domains. Jargon\ndefinitely has its place in the world as a means of making communication between\nexperts more efficient and precise. But suppose it is used in the wrong context,\nfor example, in an app intended for end consumers. In that case, it can have a\nclear negative impact on the communication between the application and the user.\nWhen niche words and phrases are used in applications intended for users who are\nnot experts in the domain, these words become meaningless and hold no value. It\nobfuscates and complicates meaning, which can be irritating and off-putting to\nusers and ultimately detrimental to both the user and the application.\n\nFrom my research, I can say that pretty much all blockchain applications are\nfull of jargon. While the terms \"**airdrop**”, \"**oracles**”, \"**smart\ncontracts**” and \"**gas**\" may be second nature to blockchain enthusiasts, they\nare meaningless and confusing to people taking their first steps into\nblockchain.\n\n## Why Jargon is bad\n\n> [...] he will be able to speak of it in the easy language, and with the\n> completeness of conviction, with which he talks of any ordinary every-day\n> matter. If he does not, he will be afraid to wander beyond the limits of the\n> technical phraseology which he has got up; and a dead dogmatism, which\n> oppresses, or raises opposition, will take the place of the lively confidence,\n> born of personal conviction [...] - Aldous Huxley on teaching [1](#1)\n\nThere are two ways in which jargon can be bad. The first is when it is poorly\nformed — for example, when it is linguistically incorrect, a misnomer,\nunnecessarily long, or similar (a more detailed list can be found in [2](#2)).\nAlthough jargon in blockchain often falls into this category (i.e.,\n**Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge** or zkSNARK\n👀), I will focus on the second type of Jargon in this article: jargon that is\nill-adapted to its audience.\n\nThis second poor use of jargon is anywhere in an application intended for\nend-users who are not blockchain experts. Likely, the majority of blockchain\nusers will not understand blockchain jargon when they are first getting started.\nAnd if jargon is not understood, it might lead to unwanted outcomes.\n\nUsers only have limited mental energy at their disposal. In order to understand\njargon that they are not familiar with, they must expend some of that mental\nenergy to hypothesize about the word or look it up. More energy is then used to\nread and absorb the rest of the sentence, and the remaining mental energy must\nbe used to internalize the sentence’s content and to understand the meaning.\nThat means that the more frequently jargon is used in an app, the more time and\nattention users must spend absorbing and understanding the information. Time and\nattention that should instead be spent on what's important at this point\n—understanding the information you want to convey in your interface.\n\nIn summary, jargon forces new users to spend unnecessary mental energy on\nunderstanding new, obscure words. Instead **this energy should be used on\nactually understanding the product** and any information that is necessary for\nusers to be able to use the app successfully.\n\nThis extra effort often leads to frustration on the part of users. It can lead\nto fundamentals being misunderstood and wrong actions being taken. Erroneous\naction in blockchain is often much more fatal than in traditional web\napplications, because many actions in blockchain cannot be reversed. In the\nworst case, jargon could lead users to abandon an app out of frustration and\nlack of understanding.\n\nFinally, jargon makes an app less accessible because it disadvantages people\nwith cognitive/learning disabilities and people with limited language\ncomprehension.\n\n## Jargon in Blockchain applications\n\nThe following screenshots are not meant to criticize the design of the apps. On\nthe contrary, most of the applications shown are very well designed! Some of\nthese apps may have deliberately chosen to use particular jargon, because their\napp’s target audience is more experienced users. Thus, these screenshots are\nonly meant to be examples of the prevalence of jargon in blockchain applications\nin general.\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mx-auto md:-mx-6 lg:-mx-8 xl:-mx-28 my-8\">\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1 sm:col-span-3\">\n    \u003Cimg className=\"w-full h-auto rounded-lg\" src=\"/images/blog/jargon/gnosis-safe-transaction.webp\" alt=\"Gnosis Safe transaction interface showing 'Contract interaction' details with transaction hash, SafeTxHash, nonce, created/executed timestamps, and delegate call information highlighted in red\" />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        className=\"h-auto w-full rounded-lg\"\n        src=\"/images/blog/jargon/lumi-wallet-mnemonic.webp\"\n        alt=\"Lumi wallet interface showing mnemonic phrase entry with 'Write down your mnemonic phrase' instruction highlighted in red, displaying word '1/12: helmet' and Next button\"\n    />\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        className=\"h-auto w-full rounded-lg\"\n        src=\"/images/blog/jargon/bitcoin-technical-settings.webp\"\n        alt=\"Bitcoin wallet settings menu showing technical options including Connection Mode, Redeem Private Key, Sync Blockchain, Enable Segwit, and Bitcoin Nodes, all highlighted in red box\"\n    />\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        className=\"h-auto w-full rounded-lg\"\n        src=\"/images/blog/jargon/wallet-tools-menu.webp\"\n        alt=\"Mobile wallet Tools menu displaying options like Buy AWC, Membership, Add token, Wallet Connect, with Airdrop and Private keys highlighted in red boxes\"\n    />\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1 md:col-span-3\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        className=\"h-auto w-full rounded-lg\"\n        src=\"/images/blog/jargon/tornado-cash-products.webp\"\n        alt=\"Tornado Cash 'Our Products' page showing four services: Governance, Anonymity Mining (highlighted), Compliance, and Trusted Setup Ceremony (highlighted), with Initiation section at bottom\"\n    />\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1 md:col-span-3\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        className=\"h-auto w-full rounded-lg\"\n        src=\"/images/blog/jargon/opensea-nft-platforms.webp\"\n        alt=\"OpenSea NFT platform comparison showing Rarible (ERC1155 standard), Mintbase (minting ERC721s), and Cargo (token minting platform for ERC721s) with technical terms highlighted in red\"\n    />\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        className=\"h-auto w-full rounded-lg\"\n        src=\"/images/blog/jargon/private-keys-security.webp\"\n        alt=\"Mobile wallet onboarding screen showing vault illustration with Ethereum and Bitcoin logos, title 'Private and secure' with 'Private keys never leave your device' highlighted in red box\"\n    />\n\u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"col-span-1\">\n    \u003Cimg className=\"w-full h-auto rounded-lg\" src=\"/images/blog/jargon/ethereum-staking-apr.webp\" alt=\"Ethereum 2.0 staking interface showing Ethereum diamond logo with '2.0' text, explaining staking rewards with total staked amount of 2,441,666 ETH and current APR of 10.02%\" />\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf blockchain products are to be usable by everyone, at every level of\nunderstanding, then applications will have to communicate to users in a way that\neveryone can quickly and easily understand. They should use jargon sparsely, and\ncommunicate in as plain language as possible. Otherwise, as described above,\nniche phrases will increase users’ mental overhead considerably. I know that it\nis difficult to determine what is jargon and what is not when you are deeply\nfamiliar with a subject. It happens to me all the time. However, as designers\n(and people interested in design), it's our job to bridge the gap between\nspecialists and end-users. We should take a step back and evaluate if all the\ninformation in the text of an application is easy and quick to understand. In\nthe end, an easy to understand application creates the best outcomes for\neveryone — inside and outside the blockchain domain.\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n1: \u003Ca name=\"1\" href=\"https://mathcs.clarku.edu/huxley/CE3/SciEd.html\">Scientific\nEducation: Notes of an After-Dinner Speech, Aldous Huxley, 1869\u003C/a>\n\n2:\n\u003Ca name=\"2\" href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/J8JJ-4YD0-4R00-G5N0\">Scientific\nJargon, Good and Bad, Russel Hirst, 2003\u003C/a>","src/content/blog/jargon.mdx","4919223bc868d214","jargon.mdx","recovery",{"id":142,"data":144,"body":149,"filePath":150,"digest":151,"legacyId":152,"deferredRender":31},{"title":145,"date":146,"slug":142,"excerpt":147,"coverImage":148,"author":117},"Recovery","09.08.2021","With the need to do their own backups, users have a high level of responsibility, which is uncommon among other popular apps.

With crypto,\nyour funds exist in a decentralized system rather than being held by a company.\nA user can interact with this decentralized system using two different\n(numerical) keys, a public and a private key. The public key allows you to\nreceive transactions (your address is generated from this public key), while the\nprivate key is necessary to send transactions. This system is called asymmetric\ncryptography and is a vital aspect of all Blockchains. The private key is used\nto authorize a transaction. It is the proof that you are the owner of the\naccount. As the name suggests, this private key is supposed to be private; only\nthe user themself should have access to it, so only they can control the funds.\nConsequently, the user has full responsibility for their funds. If a user loses\ntheir private key, they cannot call anyone to help them recover it. The seed, an\ninitial random input from which the keys are created, needs to be backed up in\norder to be recovered. Otherwise, someone who loses their seed won't be able to\nrecover their private key and will lose their funds forever.\n\nThis responsibility, the need for backups, and the backup methods themselves are\nthe UX problems I will discuss in this article.\n\n## The Problem\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    src=\"/images/blog/recovery/wallet-recovery-phrase.webp\"\n    alt=\"Mockup mobile app technical support screen with blue logo, titled 'Technical Support', explaining how to restore lost account access with contact information including phone number +1 (555) 123-4567 and email support@example.com\"\n    direction=\"left\"\n>\n\nThe self-sovereignty of cryptocurrencies is what attracts many people, so there\nis no changing the fact that users must take full responsibility for their keys\nand, consequently, their funds.\n\nEven though people value the self-sovereignty of cryptocurrencies, many\nunderestimate what kind of responsibility it entails. As a result, many people\nback up their wallet poorly or don't back it up at all. There are many accounts\nof people losing huge amounts of money because they haven’t properly backed up\ntheir wallet. There are studies which suggest that about 20% of bitcoin has been\nlost forever (irretrievably stuck in wallets). [1](#1), [2](#2)\n\nI think that backing up one's wallet is underestimated because such a high level\nof self-responsibility is uncommon amongst most services and products. How many\ntraditional web products do you know where you can't recover your account\nthrough their customer support?\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\nIn addition, many wallets provide terrible UX during the backup process:\n\n- They don't educate their users well enough about their responsibilities when\n  using cryptocurrencies and how important it is for them to backup their wallet\n  properly!\n- Many wallets don't force their users to backup.\n    - Even though backing up might be inconvenient at first, there is no worse\n      user experience than losing all your funds!\n- Many new users might even need tips on how and where to store their backup.\n  Telling users just to \"write these words on a piece of paper and store them in\n  a safe place\" won't be enough for many users. What is a safe place?\n    - When I created my first wallet, I had to go out of my way and research\n      best practices on where to store a backup.\n\nA good portion of the lost Bitcoin is likely a result of users not being\nactively aware of the high level of self-responsibility. This is mostly a\nproblem of wallet providers failing to properly guide and inform their users of\nthis responsibility. As a result, people underestimate the problem and are at\nrisk of losing access to their funds.\n\n## Backup Methods\n\nLet’s say that our users have learned about their responsibility and are aware\nthat they need to backup. Now the inconvenient part begins, the backup process.\nA seed (from which the private and public key are generated) usually looks\nsomething like this:\n\n`770cf2cc7e97cd6174d3cdd02d346e43ddaa1df00f5b42d4b71bb4dcc806426077665777da53d5f022f76607e72c7361463bc21522444d9512a0d24ebd51b0ab`\n\nYou could, of course, back up this seed directly, but it would provide the same\nissues current crypto addresses have, as discussed in the Address article:\n\n- Due to the length and complexity, it would be easy to make mistakes when\n  writing down your seed manually.\n- It has no clear structure to it, so it would be hard to spot a mistake.\n- Making a mistake in the backup process would, of course, be detrimental, since\n  you would be lulling yourself into a false sense of security.\n\nOther backup methods have been devised to improve the backup process’s user\nexperience. In the following section, I will present the most popular method as\nwell as one promising alternative.\n\n### Mnemonic Phrase\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    src=\"/images/blog/recovery/metamask-secret-phrase.webp\"\n    alt=\"Mobile wallet recovery phrase screen titled 'Here is your recovery phrase' with 24 numbered words from 'seed' to 'pulse', with instructions to write it down and resist temptation to email or screenshot it\"\n    direction=\"right\"\n>\n\nCurrently, the most common way of generating and, consequently, backing up a\nwallet is a so-called \"seed phrase\" or \"mnemonic phrase\". The \"seed phrase\" is\nusually a group of 12 to 24 words. A mnemonic phrase usually looks something\nlike this:\n\n`stem foam found piano cricket gorilla main you vacant cruel antique rifle`\n\nThese words can be used to create the seed and accordingly the private and\npublic keys. If the device on which your wallet is stored is broken or lost, you\ncan use your seed phrase to restore it on another device. These words are\nusually written down on a piece of paper (or similar) and stored in a \"safe\nplace\" (or multiple safe places). A mnemonic phrase is already better than the\nraw seed because it solves the previously mentioned issues, but it also comes\nwith some drawbacks. Writing down the potentially 24-word-long phrase manually\nmultiple times, storing it in numerous safe places, and maintaining those\n(making sure they are not lost or destroyed) is a non-trivial mental effort.\nLooking at the statistic that at least 20% of all bitcoins are already lost\nsuggests that many people fail at this stage in the backup process.\n\nAdditionally, mnemonic phrases don't prevent theft. Quite the contrary actually,\nbecause there are now two attack vectors: the wallet and the papers with the\nseed phrase written on it. There are methods to partially circumvent this\nproblem. However, there are still security issues, and increasing security would\nincrease the mental overhead and worsen the UX of backing up even more.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n### Social Recovery\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    src=\"/images/blog/recovery/recovery-phrase-warning.webp\"\n    alt=\"Mobile onboarding screen with superhero illustration wearing red cape and mask, titled 'With Argent, you use guardians' explaining that guardians are trusted people and devices who can help recover your wallet if phone is lost or stolen\"\n    direction=\"left\"\n>\n\nIn an effort to provide a better user experience during the backup process and\nhigher security overall, some wallets have adopted a \"social recovery\" process.\nWith social recovery, users won't have to write down a seed phrase. Instead,\nusers appoint guardians to their wallets.\n\nThese guardians can be other devices, friends and family, as well as third-party\nproviders.\n\nIf the wallet is lost, the user can ask the guardians to reinstate the wallet on\nanother device. To do that, guardians just have to sign a transaction, similar\nto a normal cryptocurrency transfer.\n\nSocial recovery already protects against loss very well. However, another step\nmust be taken to prevent theft because the wallet could still be hijacked or\nstolen, and the thief could easily transfer out all the funds. Argent, the first\nand still most popular social recovery wallet, uses spending limits to prevent\nmajor losses from theft. With Argent, the user can set a spending limit. Users\ncan freely spend their funds up to the limit, but after reaching the limit,\nfurther transactions have to be approved by the guardians. The UX of social\nrecovery is definitely much better than that of seed phrases. Social recovery\nprovides better protection against loss and theft and it also decreases the\nmental overhead for users.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\nBut there are still points that users might find inconvenient:\n\n- You still have the mental effort of thinking about backing up your wallet.\n    - You have to think about potential candidates for guardians. Who can you\n      trust to take that role? Might they potentially conspire to take control\n      of your funds? etc.\n- Many people don't have anyone else in their social circle who uses\n  cryptocurrencies. Finding guardians might be difficult for them since having a\n  wallet is a requirement to being a guardian.\n- It might take a considerable amount of time to recover your wallet. You will\n  have to contact the majority of your guardians and ask them to approve the\n  reinstatement of your wallet or a transaction that exceeds your spending\n  limit.\n    - This might be incredibly frustrating if you have to make an important\n      payment, and now you have to wait for your guardians to approve your\n      transaction or reinstatement.\n- Due to the transparent nature of Blockchain, if someone knows your address,\n  they can see how many cryptocurrencies you own and your entire transaction\n  history. When you add someone (friends or family) as a guardian, they will\n  know your address. - A big part of what makes social recovery wallets so\n  appealing is that friends and family (instead of corporations and other\n  devices) are your \"guardians\" and can potentially help you recover your\n  wallet. However, many people might be uncomfortable with their social circle\n  knowing about their personal wealth and transactions. - Imagine you would like\n  to buy something that you are embarrassed about and that is over your spending\n  limit. You would have to ask your Guardians if they could approve this\n  embarrassing transaction.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAccording to some reports, many people live paycheck to paycheck ex. 54% of\npeople in the USA. [3](#3) If Blockchain is going to hold a significant portion\nof the wealth of a large portion of the population in the future, then recovery\nmethods will have to improve. Most of the world's population could not afford to\nlose a significant portion of their savings. Statistics show that over 20% of\nbitcoin's supply has already been lost and about 4% of the current supply is\nlost annually. Statistics like these suggest that it is relatively easy to lose\none's cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe backup and recovery processes should definitely not be an afterthought in\nthe design process of a wallet. While the backup process might be cumbersome for\nusers I think there is no worse wallet user experience than losing access to all\nof your funds.\n\nThe first step for preventing potential loss is for wallet providers to properly\neducate their users about their self-responsibility and the importance of\nbacking up. Mnemonic phrases are obviously better than backing up the raw seed,\nbut they come with several UX and security drawbacks. While social recovery is a\nbig step forward in terms of UX and security, the UX still isn't perfect. UX\ndesigners and developers will have to continue working together to either\nimprove current recovery methods or develop new and better ones. Recovery UX\nwill play a critical role in preparing Blockchain technology to hold the wealth\nof a majority of people in the future.\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n1:\n\n\u003Ca\n    name=\"1\"\n    href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d580747908cdc0001e6792d/t/5e98dde5558a587a09fac0cc/1587076583519/research+note+4.17.pdf\"\n>\n    There Will Never Be More Than 14 Million Bitcoins, Cane Island Digital\n    Research, 2020\n\u003C/a>\n\n2:\n\n\u003Ca\n    name=\"2\"\n    href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/bitcoin-market-data-exchanges-trading\"\n>\n    60% of Bitcoin is Held Long Term as Digital Gold.

For many people, it was (and is)\n    their first interaction with the Internet and a gateway to many other\n    services (aka. sign-up with E-Mail). Luckily we all got an E-Mail with the\n    **mail@example.com** format instead of an IP address (which is the actual\n    address computers use in the background) like **123.456.78.90**. Having a\n    human-readable email address name or website name like **example.com** is,\n    of course, way more convenient than having to remember the actual IP address\n    — a “random” string of numbers. The precedent of using names instead of IP\n    addresses on the user side was set in the 1970s on the ARPAnet — a\n    predecessor to the Internet. In 1971, Peggy Karp suggested standardizing the\n    mapping of names to IP addresses. [1](#1), [2](#2) This custom was later\n    adopted on the Internet in the form of domain names like **example.com**,\n    **example.org** or **example.xyz**. Mapping names to IP addresses for the\n    sake of usability is by no means a new idea. On the contrary, it was\n    conceived almost 20 years before the invention of the Internet as we know it\n    today.\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Addresses in Blockchain\n\n\u003CFloatImage \n  src=\"/images/blog/addresses/eth-wallet-receive.webp\"\n  alt=\"Mobile cryptocurrency wallet screen showing 'Receive ETH' interface with a QR code and the Ethereum address '0x73802712969993b1A74a08F326d0eb2e053555C28' displayed below it\"\n  direction=\"right\"\n>\n\nWallets on the Blockchain serve a similar purpose to E-Mail Addresses on the\nInternet. They are the gateway to most Blockchain based products and services.\nYou want to buy an NFT? You will have to \"log in\" to the NFT-marketplace and\nlater pay with your wallet. Wallets are, similarly to E-Mail on the Internet,\nthe first and primary way of interacting with this new technology (Blockchain)\nand therefore play an extremely vital role in the usability and adoption of the\nBlockchain ecosystem.\n\nUnlike mail providers, cryptocurrency wallets don't give you a nice \"name\" like\n**mail@example.com**, but an address that in most cases looks similar to this\n`0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045`. It’s not hard to see that, in\nterms of usability, this is way worse than an E-Mail-Address (which people are\nused to from the Internet). Wallet addresses are even longer and less memorable\nthan IP addresses. But the usability issues of wallet addresses don't end with\nsimply being hard to remember.\n\n- Due to their length and complexity, it is easy to make mistakes when typing\n  the address by hand.\n- It is nearly impossible to recite it to someone without either person making a\n  mistake.\n- The addresses have no apparent structure to them, so it is way harder to spot\n  mistakes. Even when you copy-paste the address but miss a character, chances\n  are you will not recognise that you made a mistake.\n- Making mistakes with crypto addresses is way more detrimental than other\n  traditional financial services since Blockchain transactions are final. You\n  cannot reverse a Blockchain transaction the same way you can reverse a bank\n  transaction by simply calling your bank.\n- Lastly, you receive a different address for every cryptocurrency. So you don't\n  have just one monstrous address but potentially dozens.\n\nConsidering how vital wallets and their addresses are to the Blockchain\necosystem, it is baffling to me that no one realized earlier in the development\nof different Blockchain protocols how important human-readable names are to the\nusability and adoption of this technology. Mapping names to addresses has been\ncommonplace since the 1970s. One can hardly expect first-time wallet users\ncoming from the user-friendly applications on the Internet to be satisfied with\nthe poor usability of crypto addresses.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Solutions\n\nOne of the first major Blockchain projects after Bitcoin was Namecoin. [3](#3)\nThe idea behind Namecoin was that the Blockchain could also be used to store\nmappings of data to names. Theoretically, Namecoin could have been used to map a\ncryptocurrency address to a .bit domain (example.bit for example), but\nunfortunately, it never gained widespread adoption due to various technical\nissues. Vitalik Buterin even referenced Namecoin in his whitepaper for Ethereum\nand suggested a similar service could be built on Ethereum: [4](#4)\n\n> _The earliest alternative cryptocurrency of all, Namecoin, attempted to use a\n> Bitcoin-like Blockchain to provide a name registration system, where users can\n> register their names in a public database alongside other data. The major\n> cited use case is for a DNS system, mapping domain names like \"bitcoin.org\"\n> (or, in Namecoin's case, \"bitcoin.bit\") to an IP address. Other use cases\n> include email authentication and potentially more advanced reputation systems.\n> Here is the basic contract to provide a Namecoin-like name registration system\n> on Ethereum_ \\[...\\]\n\nInterestingly, Vitalik doesn't reference **name → cryptocurrency address**\nmapping as a possible use case, which suggests that there still wasn't a\nwidespread awareness that this would be a UX issue. Nonetheless, it is\ninteresting that a name service on the Blockchain has been considered for a long\ntime; it just took a long time until a solution was implemented that was\ntechnically mature enough to find widespread adoption. Since Namecoin, there\nhave been several projects that aimed to solve the challenges of name mapping\nbased on Blockchain technology. In this article, however, I want to focus\nexclusively on ENS and Unstoppable Domains. These are by far the most popular\nBlockchain-based naming services that focus on mapping names to cryptocurrency\naddresses.\n\n### ENS\n\nAs the name suggests, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is built on the Ethereum\nBlockchain. ENS was first proposed by Nick Johnson in Ethereum Improvement\nProposal 137 in 2016 and was launched in 2017. It started with a rather minimal\nfeature set (you could register **.eth** domains and point them at an Ethereum\naddress) but has grown in functionality since then. The features most relevant\nto this article are:\n\n- You can map a name to any cryptocurrency address, even those that are not\n  Ethereum based. So an ENS name like example.ens can also be mapped to a\n  bitcoin address.\n- You can import some traditional domains like .xyz (with the plan to support\n  many more in the future).\n    - This opens up the possibility to have your website on example.xyz, but\n      also receive all cryptocurrencies using the same address!\n- Domain owners can create subdomains like subexample.example.eth. This allows\n  wallet providers to issue all of their users an ENS domain in the form of a\n  subdomain of their own ENS name, for example user1.wallet.eth\n\nAccording to their website, ENS is (by far) the most integrated Blockchain\nnaming standard with over 250+ integrations with different Blockchain-based\napplications. [6](#6)\n\n### Unstoppable Domains\n\nUnstoppable Domains is another Blockchain domain name provider which has a lot\nof traction. They launched their first domains, most notably **.crypto**,\nin 2019. Unstoppable Domains provides a very similar crypto address feature set\nto ENS. The only difference is that you cannot import traditional domains and an\nunstoppable domain is a one-time purchase rather than a yearly fee (like ENS).\nUnstoppable Domains currently has about 50 integrations with Blockchain based\napplications.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPersonally, I find it odd that Blockchain-based naming services, which map names\nto crypto addresses, have not been successfully implemented earlier. Even the\npeople building ARPAnet, one of the Internet’s predecessors, realized that a\nstandardized naming system is vital for the usability of their system. In\ncomparison, it took 6 years after Namecoin was released for a service to launch\n(ENS) which successfully solved the issue of mapping names to cryptocurrency\naddresses. Nonetheless, there are now two excellent services which solve the\nissue of mapping names to cryptocurrency addresses.\n\nThe final step to completely solving this UX issue is adoption by both\nBlockchain applications and users.\n\n### Adoption\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n  src=\"/images/blog/addresses/argent-username-entry.webp\"\n  alt=\"Mobile interface showing 'Please enter your Argent username' with an input field ending in '.argent.xyz' and an on-screen keyboard displayed\"\n  direction=\"left\"\n>\n\nBlockchain application developers have to embrace these services, which means\nintegrating them with their dApps and prioritising them in their interfaces. It\nisn't enough that your app can resolve ENS or unstoppable domain names in the\naddress field. If a cryptocurrency address has an ENS linked to it, you should\ndisplay it instead of the cryptocurrency address!\n\nWe need to make it the norm to see names in wallet apps instead of monstrous\ncrypto addresses!\n\n> _It’s a small change with a big psychological impact._ — Itamar Lesuisse,\n> Argent CEO, about integrating ENS.\n\nBeyond prioritizing names in interfaces, we need to make it easier and cheaper\nfor users to obtain names. Currently, users have to go out of their way to\nregister a domain and map it to their different cryptocurrency addresses. Think\nback to your first steps on the Internet: Imagine you would just have gotten an\nIP address (ex. **123.456.78.90**) as an E-Mail-Address. Would you have gone out\nof your way to get yourself a eaily readable domain name, payed 10$ for it, and\nset up the correct mapping to the IP address of your E-Mail? For most people,\nthat’s probably a no. So, we also can't expect new users coming to Blockchain to\ndo that.\n\nIdeally, wallet providers would give a free name to all of their users, maybe in\nthe form of a subdomain like **user1.wallet.eth**. At the moment, this seems\nunrealistic since creating a subdomain on the Blockchain costs a fee, which can\nbe quite high at times. So it would be uneconomical for most wallets to give\nthem away for free. Luckily ENS seems to be on top of that. They are planning to\nmove subdomain registration to L2. If you are unfamiliar with the technical term\n\"L2\" in this case, it basically means that subdomain registration would become\nso cheap that most wallet providers could give out subdomains for free.\n\n> _Which wallet provider's subdomains will become the Gmail accounts of ENS\n> names?_ — Brantly Millegan, Director of Operations @ENS\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n1: \u003Ca name=\"1\" href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc226\">\nStandardization of host mnemonics, Peggy Karp, 1971 \u003C/a>\n\n2: \u003Ca name=\"2\" href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/RFC247\">Proferred Set\nof Standard Host Names, Peggy Karp, 1971\u003C/a>\n\n3: \u003Ca name=\"3\" href=\"https://www.namecoin.org/\">Namecoin\u003C/a>\n\n4: \u003Ca name=\"4\" href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/\">Ethereum Whitepaper,\nVitalik Buterin, 2013\u003C/a>\n\n5: \u003Ca name=\"5\" href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137\">Ethereum\nImprovement Proposal 137, Nick Johnson, 2016\u003C/a>\n\n6: \u003Ca name=\"6\" href=\"https://ens.domains/\">ENS Domains\u003C/a>\n\n7: \u003Ca name=\"7\" href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.com/\">Unstoppable Domains\u003C/a>","src/content/blog/addresses.mdx","798acc08c4bf480d","addresses.mdx","figma-libraries",{"id":163,"data":165,"body":170,"filePath":171,"digest":172,"legacyId":173,"deferredRender":31},{"title":166,"date":15,"slug":163,"excerpt":167,"coverImage":168,"heroLocation":18,"author":169},"Designing Canonicals Figma libraries for performance and structure","How Canonical's Design team rebuilt their Figma libraries, with practical guidelines on structure, performance, and maintenance processes.","/images/blog/figma-libraries/canonical-ui-components.webp","Maximilian Blazek & Jan Ostrówka","The shoemakers' children have no shoes. At Canonical’s Design team, this proverb\nmanifested in our Figma libraries. While we consistently deliver high-quality\ndesigns for our diverse products used by millions of users, we had neglected our\nown Figma libraries. They had become outdated and inefficient. This year, we\ndecided to tackle this problem by developing new Figma libraries from scratch —\nones that meet our needs and that we enjoy using.\n\nThe libraries were disorganized and contained material that was still under\ndevelopment, so it was not clear what to use. They were incomplete compared to\nour codebase and the existing components were not consistently kept up to date.\nThis led to team members detaching components and creating their own local\ncomponents and small unofficial libraries. At some point we felt that enough was\nenough. We needed to do some self-care and build our Figma libraries from\nscratch that met the requirements of our usual design work.\n\nInstead of diving in headfirst, we started by aligning on how we wanted to\nstructure the libraries and what rules and methods we wanted to follow when\ncreating components. We surveyed how designers use components, gathered feedback\non problematic components in the old libraries and organized meetings with the\nteam to understand their needs. The result of this process was a detailed\n20-page specification outlining the guidelines for the new libraries.\n\nIn this blog post, we want to share some of the guidelines and processes from\nthis document to help other designers create more efficient Figma libraries.\n\n## Structure\n\n### Files\n\nIn revamping our Figma libraries, we wanted to structure them in a way that\ndesigners can easily understand and navigate the different libraries. Looking\nfor inspiration, we came across the\n[Doctolib team's article on their Figma libraries](https://medium.com/doctolib/how-we-organise-our-design-system-libraries-to-help-doctolib-designers-use-more-than-70-000-c15237c81f6c)\nand Nathan Curtis' articles on\n[Figma libraries](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/figma-shared-libraries-d2dfbf9d1b8d)\nand\n[Design system tiers](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/design-system-tiers-2c827b67eae1).\n\nThis was at a time when we were considering restructuring our design system to\ntake a **tiered approach**. At Canonical, we have to design for several\ndifferent product types: Applications, content sites, stores and pages for our\nUbuntu Pro offering. These different product categories require different design\npatterns. Therefore, it made sense to split these product category-specific\ndesign patterns into separate libraries and take a multi-tiered Design system\napproach. For our Figma libraries, we adopted the same structure. We have a\ncommon base library, but we create additional libraries for each product\ncategory.\n\n![Canonical design system hierarchy diagram showing Base library at top connecting to Apps, Sites, Stores, and Pro, each with their own Core and Domain component libraries](/images/blog/figma-libraries/canonical-library-structure.webp)\n\nFor each of these levels, we have chosen a similar library and ownership\nstructure as described in the article by the Doctolib team:\n\n- **Core components**: Generic components without data.\n- **Domain components**: Core components with data from specific products.\n- **Assets**: Such as icons and logos.\n\nEvery library is maintained by at least one dedicated library maintainer who is\nresponsible for managing contributions and keeping the library up to date and\ntidy.\n\n![Diagram showing Core components (left side with Table component selected) vs Domain components (right side showing MAAS and LXD versions of tables with different styling)](/images/blog/figma-libraries/core-vs-domain-components.webp)\n\nIf you want to learn more about the core and domain component paradigm, we\nrecommend reading the\n[Doctolib article](https://medium.com/doctolib/how-we-organise-our-design-system-libraries-to-help-doctolib-designers-use-more-than-70-000-c15237c81f6c),\nit's well worth a read! This approach, especially the domain components, allows\nus to achieve greater consistency between products.\n\n### Pages\n\nWithin each file, we maintain a strict policy of **one component per page**. The\npages are sorted alphabetically and divided into sections that represent our\ncomponent levels.\n\n![Figma library file structure showing Pages section with Patterns (Login form, User management table, Permissions graph), Complex components (Side navigation, Table), and Components (Input, Button, Node visualisation, Checkbox)](/images/blog/figma-libraries/figma-file-structure.webp)\n\nTo maintain this structure and avoid the same problems we had in our old\nlibraries, we have set up the library to be **view-only**. Only the library\nmaintainers have access to edit it. This reduces the risk of accidentally making\nchanges and leaving unnecessary items in view. Similar to how the main branch of\na code repository would normally be protected.\n\n## Performance\n\nWhile our new file structure improved navigation, we also wanted to tackle\nperformance.\n[Figma's recent update](https://www.figma.com/blog/speeding-up-file-load-times-one-page-at-a-time/)\nhas made file loading dynamic — now pages load individually rather than all at\nonce. However, it is still good practice to split large (library) files into\nseveral smaller files to ensure that we don't hit\n[Figma's 2 GB memory limit per file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040528173-Reduce-memory-usage-in-files#memory).\n\nOpening a file no longer takes forever, but loading heavy pages sometimes does.\nThat's why the “one component per page” rule is not only important for\nstructural reasons, but also for performance reasons. If a page is not\noverloaded with several components, the loading of library pages is considerably\nfaster.\n\nWhile file and page optimizations only affect the library itself,\ncomponent-level decisions affect the designers' working files. If the components\nare not set up correctly, they can slow down these files significantly.\n\nThe main culprits of poorly performing components are:\n\n- A large number of layers\n- Heavy assets\n- Heavy effects\n\n### Number of layers\n\nAs described in\n[another Doctolib article](https://medium.com/doctolib/building-smarter-figma-components-crafting-for-efficiency-91704229643)\n(yes, we like their articles), there are a few usual suspects when it comes to\nthe high number of layers.\n\n#### Variants\n\nWhen a component is placed in a design file, Figma loads every variant of a\ncomponent into the file. This means that even if a component looks light in the\nlayer view, it can be quite heavy if that component has many variants or\nvariants with a high number of layers. You can test this by opening the\n[memory usage tool in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040528173-Reduce-memory-usage-in-files#01H8HER66S8MW9E8E9HYKHXRVM).\n\n![Comparison of Figma memory usage showing two panels: left panel shows 1.7% total memory used with 3,334 total layers (circled in red) for a variant component, right panel shows 0.4% total memory used with 11 total layers for an instance swap component](/images/blog/figma-libraries/figma-memory-usage-comparison.webp)\n\nTo counteract this, we try to keep the number of variants to a minimum and\ninstead use other properties such as boolean, text and instance swapping or\nvariable modes. We also try not to pack everything into one component. If a\ncomponent starts to have too many variants, we take that as a sign that we\nshould split up the component.\n\n#### Nested components\n\nComponents frequently need to contain other components \\- for example, a modal\nmight include a button component. However, this nesting can also impact\nperformance: As mentioned in the previous point, when a component is loaded, all\nof its variants are loaded as well.\n\nThis cascading effect means that each nested component brings along all of its\nown variants. As nesting depth increases, the number of loaded variants can grow\nexponentially, resulting in a lot of layers.\nTo optimize performance, we try to minimize component nesting, especially if\nthey have variants.\n\n#### Variable number of items\n\n![Figma interface showing segmented control component on left and instance swap panel on right with various content options like [1 item], [2 items], [3 items], [4 items] with preview thumbnails](/images/blog/figma-libraries/figma-segmented-control-instance-swap.webp)\n\nThere are certain components that contain multiple, repeated subitems, such as\ntabs in a tab bar. Depending on the use case, you may only need 3 tabs or maybe\n10. Figma doesn't currently provide a way to handle this gracefully. To create\na component with enough flexibility, many of us have simply included 10 tabs in\nthe component so that designers can show and hide the tabs as needed.\n\nBut even hidden layers contribute to the total number of layers. So this\napproach with a lot of hidden, unused layers unnecessarily reduces the\nperformance of a component. What the Doctolib team suggests instead, and what we\nhave also adopted, is the creation of **helper components**.\n\nIn the case of the tabs example, you would create helper components for one tab,\ntwo tabs, three tabs and so on. Then you would create an instance swap property\nin the tabs component that allows you to select these components and therefore\nthe number of tabs you have in your tabs component. This not only reduces the\nnumber of layers to the amount you actually need, but also makes changing the\nnumber of elements more ergonomic. You no longer have to go to the layer tree to\nchange the number of elements, but can change them in the properties window\nalong with all other properties.\n\n### Heavy assets\n\nHeavy assets, such as images, require careful implementation in Figma libraries.\nThat's why we separate our assets such as icons, logos and illustrations into\ntheir own library file. This separation helps to ensure that Figma's memory\nlimits are not reached with large asset collections.\n\nWe also **optimize all assets** (e.g. [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo),\n[oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng)) before adding them to the\nlibrary. This optimization targets two important performance factors. Firstly,\nit helps to comply with memory limitations. Secondly, it reduces download times\nwhen pages are opened on devices as each asset needs to be loaded for display.\n\nWe have also refined our approach to asset-heavy components. For example, we had\npreviously used an icon component with variants, which led to performance\nissues. This approach was problematic, because each variant contained a heavy\nasset. The component had numerous variants and was often nested within other\ncomponents.\n\nIn our current solution, each asset is a separate component. We use a ‘wrapper\ncomponent’ that contains only one icon component and uses the instance swap\nproperties with the other icon components as preferred values. This method\nallows for easy selection of icons while maintaining performance.\n\n### Heavy effects\n\nWhile the other performance considerations relate more to memory management in a\nfile, this consideration relates more to the actual rendering of the file.\nEffects such as color gradients, drop shadows etc. require more processing power\nthan, for example, a simple rectangle. The Figma renderer is very good, but too\nmany effects in one component, especially if they are stacked on top of each\nother, will affect the rendering performance. Therefore, when creating\ncomponents, we are careful not to stack too many effects on top of each other.\n\n## Discoverability\n\n![Comparison showing Figma variant dropdown menu on left with 'Disconnected' selected from options like Connected, Copy, Debug, Delete, vs instance swap interface on right showing icon selection grid with various icons like desktop, edit, refresh, etc.](/images/blog/figma-libraries/figma-variant-vs-instance-swap.webp)\n\nUsing the ‘Instance Swapping’ property instead of variants, as we described in\nthe previous section, had an unintended positive side effect for us. While the\nvariant property only shows a list of the variant names, the instance swap\nproperty shows a searchable list of components and their previews. For the icon\ncomponent, for example, this meant that we now (right side) have previews of\nicons instead of just their names, which is a great improvement for icon\ndiscoverability.\n\nAnother discoverability feature we have implemented in our Figma libraries is\nthe use of **keywords** in component descriptions. Components can have\nsynonymous names in different design systems. We have used Figma's component\ndocumentation feature to insert alternative names as keywords. For example, we\nlabel the input field component with ‘text field’, ‘text box’, ‘form field’ and\n‘entry field’. If we use the search function in the Figma UI, in the component\nsearch field or in the instance swapping property, the component will be\ndisplayed regardless of which synonym we search for, as long as we included it\nin the keywords.\n\n## Process\n\n![Screenshot of Figma notification system showing multiple overlapping notifications from 'webbot' about changes to Google Drive isometric-illustrations and other updates](/images/blog/figma-libraries/figma-update-notifications.webp)\n\n### Keeping things up to date\n\nCreating a library is one challenge; maintaining it is another entirely. Our\nprevious library struggled from the complexity of tracking changes across a\nlarger organization like Canonical. Design system updates, code changes, and new\nillustrations stored across different platforms \\- keeping everything in sync\nproved challenging. There was no defined process to keep the library up to date\nand maintain it compared to the sources of truth. So over time it became\noutdated and less valuable to the team as a result.\n\nWhen defining the specification for Figma libraries mentioned at the beginning,\nwe therefore made sure that we also defined a process for maintaining the\nlibraries. In this process, a clear ownership of the libraries is defined \\- the\n**library maintainers**. These library maintainers are, as the name suggests,\nresponsible for keeping the libraries up to date. There must be a **source of\ntruth** for each library and component/asset. Therefore, keeping it up to date\nmeans following the source of truth as closely as possible. Anything that is not\nin the source of truth will not be allowed into the library.\n\nTo support our library maintainers, we developed a bot for our internal\nmessaging platform that monitors these sources and alerts us to relevant changes\nthrough webhooks, whether they occur in GitHub, Google Drive, or other\nplatforms.\n\n### Contributions on the pro plan\n\nWe want to keep our design libraries as **platform-agnostic** as possible to be\nprepared for any changes in design tools that may come in the future. For this\nreason, we are reluctant to tie ourselves more to the Figma ecosystem and its\norganization plan, which provides marginally better features for a considerably\nhigher cost.\n\nThe only real downside for us in this regard is the contribution to libraries.\nWithout the branching feature of the organization plan, it is difficult to\nrestrict the editing of the library file (to prevent accidental changes) and\nstill allow contributions. This is the procedure we have introduced to make it\nwork anyway (if you know of a better way please let us know!):\n\n#### Existing component improvements.\n\nThe trickiest part is updating existing components, as only the library\nadministrators have edit access to the library file. What we have arrived at is\nthat if someone discovers a bug in an existing component, they write a request\nto update the library, detailing what is wrong, what needs to be fixed and\nperhaps how they intend to fix it. This request is sent to the maintainer of the\nlibrary.\n\n#### New components\n\nFor new components, we ask contributors to create the proposed component in a\nseparate file. There they can build the component, test it and get feedback from\nother designers. We provide\n[a checklist](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1435297834108003391/vanilla-core-component-library)\nof things they need to do in order for the component to be included in the\nlibrary. Once they have completed the checklist, they contact a library\nmaintainer to add the new component to the library. The library maintainer\nperforms a final check and then adds it to the library.\n\nThe advantage of this contribution process is that we can accept contributions\nfrom external contributors in the same way as internal contributors.\n\n## Metrics\n\n![Table showing project statistics with columns for Project, File, # Non Component Nodes, # Component Nodes, and % Component Nodes, displaying data for 7 different projects with component usage percentages ranging from 5% to 70%](/images/blog/figma-libraries/component-usage-statistics.webp)\n\nBefore we started creating the new libraries, we also implemented a custom way\nto track the usage of Figma components and Figma libraries in our design team.\nWe took inspiration from the article by the\n[Pinterest team](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-pinterests-design-systems-team-measures-adoption/)\nand the\n[Uber team's approach](https://youtu.be/PMz1DbaeoDE?feature=shared&t=213). With\nthe code we wrote, we can track how often our designers use components in their\nfiles, which libraries those components come from, and how often they detach\ncomponents.\n\nWe wanted to do this before we release the new libraries so we can understand\nthe adoption of our new libraries over time. The component usage metrics and\nremoval rates can give us an indication of which components may need to be\nimproved in the design system in general or in Figma.\n\n## Transition\n\nWhen we finalized the new libraries, we created a transition plan for the team\nfrom the old to the new library.\n\nWe started with a \"beta\" version where the team could try out the new library\nand tell us what works and what doesn't. Once we had integrated all the feedback\nand moved to the stable version, we went through our old library and the smaller\nunofficial libraries that were floating around and marked them all as\ndeprecated. We put this notice everywhere \\- in file names, page names,\ncomponent names, component descriptions and on the library cover. Wherever we\ncould, we added a link to the new library in the deprecation notice. This helped\nwith notifying users of the library deprecation which we weren’t able to reach\nthrough other channels.\n\nWe also set the old libraries to \"view only\" and moved them to an archive\nproject. We let the team know they could keep using the old libraries for a few\nmonths while transitioning, but should pick the new library for any new work.\nFrom this transition period onwards, we wouldn't fix anything in the old\nlibraries or release new versions.\n\nAfter the transition period, we unpublished the old libraries so they don’t show\nup in the library tab anymore and no new components can be added to design\nfiles.\n\nWe started this journey towards new libraries with the base core component\nlibrary and the base assets library. Now that we have wrapped up the transition\nperiod for these libraries, we're sharing the files with the\n[Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1435297834108003391) and\nwriting this blog post.\n\nWe'll be creating more libraries following these principles over the next few\nmonths. If we learn anything new while making them, we'll share that with you\ntoo!\n\n---\n\n[Explore how we do open design and connect with our team!](https://canonical.design/sauce/)","src/content/blog/figma-libraries.mdx","bbe5028e2a821bfa","figma-libraries.mdx","trust",{"id":174,"data":176,"body":180,"filePath":181,"digest":182,"legacyId":183,"deferredRender":31},{"title":177,"date":146,"slug":174,"excerpt":178,"coverImage":179,"author":117},"Trust","To avoid alienating users, Blockchain applications need to explain why interactions are different compared to 'traditional' applications, and which information users need to pay special attention to.","/images/blog/trust/education-and-explanations.webp","## The Problem\n\nMost people would agree that you have to be able to trust the system that holds\na significant amount of your (financial) wealth. Therefore, it’s crucial for the\nmass adoption of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, that users coming into the\nBlockchain ecosystem learn to trust it. Trust often appears to involve the\nbelief in an explanation of the person or thing we do or do not trust. In this\nsense, trust and explanation seem to be inherently linked to one another.\n[1](#1) In previous articles in this series, we established that cryptocurrency\nwallets would be one of the first and primary interactions with Blockchain\ntechnology for many people. Considering that trust will be crucial to the\nadoption of Blockchain, and that wallets are one of the first interactions with\nthe technology, it seems that the burden of educating new users and creating\ntrust falls on wallets. In my research, I found that many wallets don't provide\nenough explanation to cultivate trust. When I think back to my first experience\nwith cryptocurrencies and when I created my first wallet, I had to go out of my\nway to inform myself about the peculiarities of Blockchain. **Why is the\ntransaction fee different every time I make a transaction?** The absence of such\nexplanations might not prevent users from being able to operate a wallet, or\nother Blockchain applications. However, it may make them refrain from actually\nusing these applications if they mistrust the technology. **Why is the\ntransaction fee suddenly so high? Am I being scammed?**\n\n> _1.)

Do benefits arise from the use of explanations? What kinds of benefits?_\n> Explanation use has been shown to have positive outcomes, better performance,\n> higher user perceptions of the system and in some cases, improved learning.\n> [2](#2)\n\nAs this paper suggests, it’s especially the peculiarities, the _perceived\nanomalies_, that users seek explanations for. Blockchain has many of these\npeculiarities. Most of the perceived anomalies in the context of Blockchain are\nthe differences in interactions on decentralized applications when compared to\nweb applications we know today. Users will generally expect most interactions to\nbe the same on Blockchain as they are in \"traditional\" web products and\nservices. If an interaction is perceived as different in Blockchain, they will\nseek an explanation for the cause of this anomaly. In the case of transaction\nfees, users will quickly notice that the fees seem to change every time they\nmake a transaction; they will want to know why that's the case. If no sufficient\nexplanation is provided, they might become skeptical and develop distrust for\nthe technology.\n\n## Peculiarities\n\nIn the following section of the article, I will use cryptocurrency transactions\nas an example to show the type of Blockchain-specific interactions new users\nmight perceive as abnormal and therefore need an explanation. Of course, this is\nnot an exhaustive list of all interactions that should be explained. Instead,\nthis should serve as an example of the type of interactions I think need an\nexplanation.\n\n### Transaction fees\n\nOne of the biggest \"anomalies\" of cryptocurrency transactions is the fees. Each\ntransaction fee is determined by how busy the network is and how much the user\nis willing to pay for the transaction to go through more quickly. People already\nfully accustomed to cryptocurrencies might think nothing of it, but being able\nto set your own transaction fee is quite an unusual interaction. Basically,\nminers can choose which transactions they want to include in the block they will\nmine — obviously they want the ones where they earn the most, so the\ntransactions which pay the highest transaction fee are given priority.\n\nPeople who are used to transactions from traditional payment services may be\nconfused by the fluctuating transaction fees because they are only used to no\nfees, fixed fees ($0.99 per transaction), and percentage fees (10% of\ntransaction). Additionally in many of the biggest Blockchains, fees can be so\nhigh (at times) that many transactions are impracticable and not cost-efficient.\n\n### Transaction time\n\nAgain, the time a transaction takes to go through depends on the amount of\ntransaction fees the user paid and how busy the network is. So, if a user\ndecides they want to cheap out on the transaction fee while the network is\nreceiving high traffic, it might take (very) long for the transaction to go\nthrough. If a user doesn't know that the transaction time is based on both the\nfee they paid and the current status of the network, they might get confused and\nfrustrated that their simple transaction is taking so long.\n\n### Transactions are public\n\nMany newspapers report on cryptocurrencies as if they are completely anonymous\nand untraceable, so it might be surprising to users unfamiliar with Blockchain\nthat this is not the case. [3](#3) In fact, most Blockchains are only\npseudonymous and transactions are public for anyone to see. If someone knows\nyour cryptocurrency address, they can see how much \"money\" is in your account,\nas well as every transaction your account has ever been involved in. This might\nlead to uncomfortable situations if a user thinks that their transactions are\nprivate (as they are in traditional payment services) because anyone who knows\ntheir address could see all of their potentially compromising transactions.\n\n### Transactions are final\n\nEssentially, transactions on Blockchains are not reversible. When people\nunintentionally make a transaction to the wrong address using traditional\nbanking services, they can easily contact customer service to reverse the\ntransaction. This is not possible in Blockchain and could be extremely\nfrustrating for users who were not aware that their transactions are\nirreversible. The only possible way that a transaction could be reversed is if\nmore than 50% of the entire Blockchain network agrees to do so, which would be\nan extremely rare occurrence.\n\n## Explanations\n\nThe following four examples explain situations where inexperienced users could\nbecome suspicious of cryptocurrency transactions — suspicion which could easily\nbe fixed by providing explanations. I will show how different wallets\nincorporate explanations for some of these interactions into their user flow.\n\n### Onboarding\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    src=\"/images/blog/trust/defi-yield-farming.webp\"\n    alt=\"DeFi yield farming interface showing farming opportunities with CAKE-BNB LP token earning 42.12% APR, displaying lock period options of 1 week, 10 weeks, and 52 weeks with corresponding APR rates\"\n    direction=\"left\"\n>\n    During the MEW app’s onboarding process, users are provided with a rundown\n    of the most important things to be aware of when dealing with\n    cryptocurrencies.

Instead of overloading users with\n    information right when they download the app, they make the information\n    available at the time it is most relevant to the user — in the transaction\n    process.\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n### Tooltips\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    src=\"/images/blog/trust/smart-contract-warning.webp\"\n    alt=\"Mobile wallet smart contract interaction warning screen with caution icon, explaining contract interactions and asking user to confirm they understand the risks\"\n    direction=\"left\"\n>\n    The Coinbase wallet provides information about miner fees in the form of a\n    tooltip. Tooltips are a way of making information available when it is most\n    relevant to a user. However, in this case, the information is only shown\n    once the user seeks out help and clicks on the tooltip.\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n### Knowledge base\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    src=\"/images/blog/trust/transaction-simulation.webp\"\n    alt=\"Transaction simulation preview showing estimated gas fees, network congestion status, and step-by-step breakdown of what will happen when the transaction is executed\"\n    direction=\"right\"\n>\n    Lastly, information can also be given in the form of a knowledge base; the\n    MEW app uses their education center as a knowledge base. The goal of a\n    knowledge base seems to be to fulfill the users' desire to learn rather than\n    to clarify inconsistencies when they come up.\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Blockchain is to hold a significant part of many people's wealth in the\nfuture, then all its users will have to learn to trust this technology. This\ntrust can be achieved through well crafted explanations. Users trust products\nand services which they believe to understand (to some degree). Since wallets\nwill be one of the first touch points for many new users, they should contain\nadequate explanation. These explanations need to focus primarily on the\nidiosyncrasies of Blockchain, i.e. the interactions that are different from what\nmost people are used to. The interactions that are perceived as different from\nthe norm will be distinct causes of skepticism, and it is precisely this\nskepticism that must be overcome in order to foster trust. In this article, I\nhave given examples of the types of interactions that should be explained and\nhow some flagship wallets are currently trying to integrate explanations into\ntheir platforms. **However, the question might arise: How can we raise the\noverall level of explanations (and their quality) industrywide?**\n\nIn my opinion, a collection of open source explanations and illustrations\nfocusing on the peculiarities of Blockchain is the answer. It would empower the\ndesigners and developers of wallets and other Blockchain applications to take\nthese explanations and integrate them into their apps. Also, it would remove\ntheir need to invest personal resources into creating high quality explanations\nand illustrations.\n\nAt some point, we would like to offer these resources on neueux. By allowing\nopen source contributors to work out which explanations and illustrations would\nbe most useful and are of high quality, we want to make a valuable contribution\nto the improvement of UX in Blockchain.\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n1: \u003Ca name=\"1\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-010-9253-3\">Explanation and\ntrust: what to tell the user in security and AI?, Wolter Pieters, 2011\u003C/a>\n\n2: \u003Ca name=\"2\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/249487\">Explanations from\nIntelligent Systems: Theoretical Foundations and Implications for Practice,\nShirley Gregor and Izak Benbasat, 1999\u003C/a>\n\n3:\n\n\u003Ca\n    name=\"3\"\n    href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/eu-to-ban-cryptocurrency-anonymity-in-anti-money-laundering-plan-1.4626129\"\n>\n    EU to ban cryptocurrency anonymity in anti-money laundering plan, Naomi\n    O’Leary, 2021\n\u003C/a>","src/content/blog/trust.mdx","43f49f39c1d5ab7a","trust.mdx","privacy",{"id":184,"data":186,"body":190,"filePath":191,"digest":192,"legacyId":193,"deferredRender":31},{"title":187,"date":114,"slug":184,"excerpt":188,"coverImage":189,"author":117},"Privacy","As seductive as a Blockchain’s other advantages are, neither companies nor individuals are particularly keen on publishing all of their information onto a public database that can be arbitrarily read without any restrictions by one’s own government, foreign governments, family members, coworkers and business competitors.","/images/blog/privacy/privacy-masks-metaphor.webp","## Transparency in Blockchain\n\n\u003CFloatImage\n    src=\"/images/blog/privacy/blockchain-address-tracking.webp\"\n    alt=\"Etherscan blockchain explorer interface showing an Ethereum address with balance of 0.00013522194265763 Ether worth $0.42, demonstrating public visibility of blockchain transactions and balances\"\n    direction=\"left\"\n>\n\nMany people, when they first discover blockchain, mistakenly assume that\nblockchain is completely anonymous and transactions are not trackable at all.\nThis misconception probably stems from the current state of news coverage about\nblockchains and cryptocurrencies. Blockchains make the news most frequently in\nthe context of terrorism and money laundering and is often presented as if it\nwere completely anonymous and untraceable — perfect for anonymous criminal\nactivity. [1](#1)\n\nBut, of course, this narrative does not correspond with the truth. With most\nblockchains and cryptocurrencies, all transaction data is freely accessible, and\neach transaction can be traced since the creation of the genesis block, i.e. the\nfirst block of the blockchain.\n\nMost blockchains are just pseudonymous, rather than anonymous. Pseudonym in this\ncontext means that your identity is not linked to your cryptocurrency address\n(which we will just refer to as an “address”). However, anyone can see all the\ntransactions that a specific address has ever been involved in using tools like\nblock explorers (such as [etherscan.io](http://etherscan.io/) for Ethereum). So,\nif you want all your (financial) transactions to remain private, you have to be\nvery careful that you never connect your identity to your cryptocurrency\naddress. If this were to happen, anyone could see every transaction you have\never made on the blockchain and how much cryptocurrency you currently own.\n\n\u003C/FloatImage>\n\n## Unintentionally linking your identity to your address\n\nNow, you might think that the solution to this problem is to simply ensure that\nyour address is never associated with your identity. But this is much more\ntricky than one might think. Even a harmless transaction like paying back a\ncolleague for lunch would make all your transactions visible to him. This means\nthat on most blockchains and with most cryptocurrencies, it is not possible to\nsend tokens to friends, family, and acquaintances with whom you do not want to\nshare your entire transaction history at the same time. However, it doesn't stop\nthere. For example, if you order something from a webshop and pay for it with\ncryptocurrencies, this webshop might store both your delivery details and your\ncryptocurrency address. Suppose the data of this webshop is leaked, for whatever\nreason. In that case, anyone who has access to this leaked data could establish\nthe connection between your identity and address and thus see your entire\ntransaction history. A paper in the Journal of Forensic Research also describes\nhow identity can be inferred from data that is freely available on the\nblockchain. The method described in this paper led to the arrest of Ross\nUlbricht, a former operator of the dark web site \"Silk Road\". [2](#2)\n\nThere are many ways to unintentionally link one's identity to one's address. In\nfact, there are many more ways in which this connection can be (forensically)\nestablished, but describing them all here is beyond the scope of this article.\nIf you want to dive deeper into this topic, check out [3](#3)!\n\n### The issue with linked identities\n\nProblems with varying degrees of severity can arise from the pseudonymous,\ntransparent nature of blockchain if an identity is inadvertently linked to an\naddress.\n\n- First, it can just be annoying. The colleague you paid back for lunch could\n  see all your transactions and might find some of your financial decisions\n  questionable.\n- Of course, the same situation could be very embarrassing. For example, if you\n  bought sex toys with this address and these transactions are evident on the\n  blockchain, the colleague could also see these \"embarrassing\" purchases.\n- Additionally, many more serious situations could also arise. For example, if\n  you live under a regime where specific sexual orientations are persecuted,\n  purchasing certain sex toys or porn could be damning. If, for some reason,\n  this purchase becomes evident through the transactions that are publicly\n  visible on the blockchain, it could be used as a tool to surveil and oppress\n  people.\n- Criminals could also exploit the transparent nature of blockchain. For\n  example, if there is a leak where delivery data is linked to cryptocurrency\n  addresses (on an e-commerce site for example), criminals could see which of\n  the leaked addresses owns the most cryptocurrencies. This information, in\n  combination with delivery data, would make it easier to plan targeted theft.\n\nAll of these problems are exacerbated by the immutable nature of blockchain. Not\nonly is every transaction viewable, but fundamentally, blockchain is immutable,\nmeaning that once the data about a transaction is on the blockchain, it can\nnever be deleted or changed. As a result, if at any time your identity is linked\nto your address and you realize that compromising transactions are coming to\nlight, you have absolutely no way to remove them from the blockchain.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are multiple UX issues that arise from the transparency of most\nblockchains. If you are not aware of these problems, it is easy to\nunintentionally link your identity to your address. This can have potentially\ndevastating consequences. There are, of course, some technical solutions for\nthis. For example, there are blockchains like Monero which are completely\nprivate. On Monero, neither the sender nor recipient nor the transaction amount\ncan be determined. For \"transparent\" blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, mixer\nservices like Tornado.cash can be used to execute private transactions. Some of\nthese more transparent blockchains are considering implementing so-called\nzk-SNARKs into their technology stacks to increase privacy. You can see that\nthere are various technical approaches to solving the privacy problem. Now, the\nquestion is **how design can contribute to solving this problem**. In my\nopinion, design can contribute via education (as already discussed in the Trust\narticle). Good design would include a general education about the transparent\nnature of most blockchains and inform users that, if they care about the privacy\nof their transactions, they should take care never to link their identity to\ntheir addresses. Additionally, good design should inform users what information\nthey are revealing about themselves when they make a transaction—similar to how\nsocial media platforms inform you about the level of privacy on your posts.\n\n---\n\n#### Sources\n\n1:\n\u003Ca name=\"1\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/eu-to-ban-cryptocurrency-anonymity-in-anti-money-laundering-plan-1.4626129\">EU\nto ban cryptocurrency anonymity in anti-money laundering plan, Naomi O’Leary,\n2021\u003C/a>\n\n2:\n\u003Ca name=\"2\" href=\"https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/bitcoin-investigations-evolving-methodologies-and-case-studies-2157-7145-1000420.pdf\">Bitcoin\nInvestigations: Evolving Methodologies and Case Studies, Andrew LR and Douglas\nOrr, 2018\u003C/a>\n\n3:\n\u003Ca name=\"3\" href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8888155\">Privacy-Preserving\nSolutions for Blockchain: Review and Challenges, Jorge Bernal Bernabe, Jose Luis\nCanovas, Jose L.

The screen\ngallery gives you an overview that lets you see not only the good designs, but\nalso where potential UX challenges may lie.\n\nWe are launching this article series to create a deeper awareness of the\nBlockchain industry's UX challenges. We believe it is important to facilitate a\ndeeper understanding of the problems before offering resources to solve them;\nthat's why we are launching this series as the next step for the platform.\n\nPlease keep in mind, that this series is aimed at designers new to Blockchain.\nSo for developers already familiar with Blockchain there will be a lot of\nredundant information. Furthermore, these articles should be understood as\nopinion pieces and not as objective scientific articles. Nonetheless I invite you\nto read through the articles if you are interested in furthering your\nunderstanding of the UX problems Blockchain products are facing.\n\nThis first article will give a brief overview of the problems we want to address\nin this series of articles.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/addresses\">\n    \u003Ch2>1. Addresses\u003C/h2>\n\u003C/a>\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/addresses\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        src=\"/images/blog/addresses/phone-crypto-address-receipt.webp\"\n        alt=\"A smartphone displaying a long cryptocurrency address as if printed on a receipt that unfolds from the phone, illustrating the impractical length of blockchain addresses\"\n    >\u003C/img>\n\u003C/a>\n\nAddresses are one of the centerpieces of everything Blockchain, and they\ntypically look like this: 0x8eD92a86148723A980A408A1De2cFE746b056b24. An address\nis a user's unique identifier to which other users can send cryptocurrencies.\nLooking at the above address, anyone can see that it is not the most optimal for\neveryday payments as it is not easy for humans to read or copy.\n\nIn the second article, we will go in-depth into why we think these addresses are\na UX issue and how current industry players are trying to solve this UX issue.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/trust\">\n    \u003Ch2>2. Trust\u003C/h2>\n\u003C/a>\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/trust\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/trust/education-and-explanations.webp\" alt=\"An open book about how education in explanations in dApps should be done.\">\u003C/img>\n\n\u003C/a>\n\nBlockchain has fundamental differences from traditional technologies that\naffect, among other things, how the app interacts with the user and vice versa.\nTo avoid alienating users, Blockchain applications need to explain why\ninteractions are different from other platforms, and which information users\nneed to pay special attention to.\n\nThe fourth article will revolve around the current state of educational content\nin Blockchain apps. Specifically, it will focus on wallets, as they are the\nfirst and primary way of interacting with Blockchain technology for most people.\nWe will then give examples of these \"special interactions\" that need to be\nexplained to newcomers and how developers could better implement educational\ncontent in Blockchain applications.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/recovery\">\n    \u003Ch2>3. Recovery\u003C/h2>\n\u003C/a>\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/recovery\">\n    \u003Cimg\n        src=\"/images/blog/recovery/broken-phone-wallet.webp\"\n        alt=\"A broken phone next to a crypto wallet recovery phrase written on a piece of paper\"\n    >\u003C/img>\n\u003C/a>\n\nIn crypto, funds exist in a decentralized system rather than being held by a\ncompany. Consequently, the user has full responsibility for their funds. If a\nuser loses their wallet, they cannot call anyone to help them recover it - the\nwallet must be backed up in order to be recovered. Backing up the wallet means\n(in most cases) writing down a secret recovery phrase that can be up to 24 words\nlong. With recovery phrases, users have a high level of responsibility, which is\nuncommon among other popular apps. The backup process and the responsibility\nthat comes with it are, therefore, a significant inconvenience to users.\n\nIn the Backup and Recovery article, we will look at why exactly this is so\ninconvenient to a user. Additionally, we will look at current implementations of\nthe backup and recovery process, as well as a promising alternative.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/accessibility\">\n    \u003Ch2>4.

We need\nto extend this inclusion further and try to make Blockchain applications more\naccessible to people with physical and mental disabilities by designing them to\nbe barrier-free.\n\nWith this article I want to draw attention to a problem that is currently hardly\ndiscussed in Blockchain, namely the accessibility of Blockchain applications.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/privacy\">\n    \u003Ch2>5.

Additionally, we will take a look at\nsome privacy-preserving Blockchain solutions out there.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/jargon\">\n    \u003Ch2>6.

It is [well documented](https://doi.org/10.2190%2FJ8JJ-4YD0-4R00-G5N0)\nthat jargon can have a negative impact on communication between professionals\nand laypeople. When niche words and phrases are used in applications that are\nintended for first time users, these unfamiliar words become meaningless jargon\nthat provides no value. It clouds and complicates meaning, which is irritating\nand alienating to users, with potentially harmful consequences to all parties.\n\nWe will explain why the use of jargon is a UX issue, how Blockchain jargon is\nused in different applications, and how common jargon could be phrased\ndifferently.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"/blog/first-crypto\">\n    \u003Ch2>7.

They provide an essential service because they\nsignificantly lower the barrier to entry for inexperienced users. Without these\nservices, inexperienced users would be overwhelmed with the interfaces and\ninteractions required to buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange.\n\nWe will look at popular On- and Off-Ramp services, their processes, and how they\nimplement into other products like wallets.","src/content/blog/ux-pitfalls-of-blockchain.mdx","47140ce7dc9f77dc","ux-pitfalls-of-blockchain.mdx"]
